  CHAPTER I.


The next morning as Miss Atkins was surveying
her drawing-room restored to its pristine primness,
and neatly shrouded in brown holland, the butler
brought her a letter. It was from her brother,
who informed her he had just espoused Miss
Maddalena Restoni. The marriage had been
solemnised at the parish registry office, and at^the
Catholic chapel in Farm Street. They were en
route for the Continent, whence they would return
in about a month's time. He also informed her that
he had disposed of his business, and definitively
retired from the City. He had given his agent full
instructions with respect to the letting of the _ house  
  
  
  VOL. II. B
<!-- Leaf 10, Page: 2 -->
in Bedford Square, and the preparation of Vachell
Court, which would be his residence for the
future. The letter ended by politely inviting h er
to precede them to Vachell, and to look upon it as
her home. In case of her doing so, the agent had
been apprised that the forming of the establishment
would be left entirely in her hands. But if she felt
that she would not live happily with the object of
his choice, he was willing to grant her any
assistance which she might require in addition to her own
income.


These news fell upon her like a cold douche.
She had for some time been aware that Richard had
been intimate with Restoni the singer. She had
been annoyed to hear of a new liaison, but taking
it for granted that such people are never respectable,
she had been only uneasy about the money which
her brother might be squandering upon her. One
would imagine that a pious Protestant, so assiduous
in devotional exercise, would have been glad that
he had married the (supposed) partner of his guilt.
But, alas ! it is not only the fashionable and worldly
who prefer that their relatives should indulge in
moderate vice under the sanction of society, than that
<!-- Leaf 11, Page: 3 -->
they should perpetuate an enormous folly, under that
of religion and respectability. The middle classes are
quite as sensible in this respect as other people.
There is scarcely a small shopkeeper, Anglican,
Wesleyan, Independent, or Baptist, who would not
feel more outraged if his son married a
maidservant than if he ruined her, and left her to
starve in the streets. Upon this point all the
religious sects in England, numerous as they are,
would be agreed, and it is one of those
commandments, which they bear engraved upon their hearts,
harder than Moses' tablets of stone : " Thou shalt
not marry with one who is poor and beneath thee in
station, nor with one who hath an ill name, lest men
laugh thee to scorn, and in this life thou prospereth
not."


Miss Atkins of course laid most of the blame
upon Maddalena. " The nasty scheming thing !" she
exclaimed between her sobs, "the vulgar, foreign
hussy ! the low creature, coming here with her shop
in her throat to ensnare poor Richard, who believes
everything that a woman tells him."


Her first impulse was to reply to her brother that
she would accept neither the home nor the money  
  
  
  B 2
<!-- Leaf 12, Page: 4 -->
which he offered. But the reflection that such a
step would be precisely what that odious woman
must desire most, made her change her mind. She
resolved to go to Vachell at once, secure the keys,
and endeavour to retain them as long as she could.
The idea of leading an opposition (that one
consolation of a fallen minister) cheered her for a little
time. But she soon relapsed into despondency.
She had hoped to have married her brother with
some young person in her own set, who respected
her as a woman, who venerated her as a saint, and
over whom she might have ruled with the double
authority of an elder sister and a priest. She read
the letter over again. It was a masterly
production, as all Atkins' business letters were. He
wanted some one to supervise his agent, to whom he
had given such large powers, and he knew no one
upon whom he could depend as he could upon his
sister. She, on the other hand, was delighted when
she found on re-perusing the letter that she was to
form an establishment. Her mortification was
half effaced by this bribe which Atkins had
appended to the bitter news. She felt the
enthusiasm of one who is appointed governor to a
<!-- Leaf 13, Page: 5 -->
maiden colony; she called on the agent that
afternoon, and went down to Vachell the next day.


Vachell Court was an old-fashioned
countryhouse, cumbrously but comfortably built, with a
tiled roof, narrow massive windows, double-doors
to all the principal rooms, extensive stables and
back-offices; a park and some acres of shrubberies,
paddock, and kitchen-garden. It possessed none of
the novelties of modern refinement, neither
conservatory, vinery, hot-house, nor landscape-garden.
Everything was old, and in a state of partial decay.
The furniture, once costly, was now mouldering.
The stained spaces left on removal of family
portraits (which alone the Vachells had not sold) had
never been filled up. The house had been let to a
family of males and one sporting girl, who had
taken it for the sake of the shooting (it was an
estate of three thousand acres, with some good
covers), and on account of its position in the
centre of a hunting county.


Miss Atkins spent the first day rambling about
the house and grounds, like a book-worm in a
precious library, too excited to examine anything
closely, but drinking in general impressions. The
<!-- Leaf 14, Page: 6 -->
next week she spent from morning till night,
scrutinising, classifying, and preparing. She
attended the hiring-fairs at Oxford and Reading, and
engaged maid-servants with plain faces and strong
arms. She made a gigantic inventory. She dusted,
scoured, scrubbed, and swept everything. She
condemned half a library, but, a much better
housekeeper than Don Quixote's, instead of burning the
dangerous books, she sent them to London to be
sold. She disposed of some coloured nudities in a
similar way. On the other hand she found that
there was very little to buy. By dint of patching
and repairing, the furniture could do very well.
Out of doors she altered little, except to turn some
flower-plots into cabbage-beds.


She employed her odd moments in writing to
Richard letters full of these domestic details,
occasionally spiced with a reproach. When the month
had elapsed she received a letter from him. He
was to arrive the next day. At four o'clock in the
afternoon she was walking up and down in the
grand and sombre drawing-room, restless but
resolute, like a general who awaits the first sight of the
enemy's columns. She took up a work of devotion and
<!-- Leaf 15, Page: 7 -->
began to read, but as she turned over each page she
glanced out of the window, which gave her a view
beyond the grounds of some ploughed fields, bisected
by a white streak of turnpike-road. A black speck
appeared thereon; she thrust a text-embroidered
marker into the book and walked to the window.
The speck expanded into a carriage-and-pair, which
entered the gate by the ruined lodge, was lost sight
of among the green trees, and thence emerging came
up to the front door with a dash.


\"So you are come back at last, Richard," said
Miss Atkins, as her brother alighted. " What
extravagance, to come with a two-horse fly, and only four
miles from the station."


William replied to this effusive welcome by
helping Maddalena out of the fly and introducing her to
his sister. She took the girl's hand in hers and
looked piercingly into her face. On the whole she
felt relieved. She had expected to see an extremely
handsome woman with painted cheeks, a theatrical
demeanour, and in a semi-stage costume like an
undress uniform. She could hardly believe that this
was the famous Restoni who stood before her in a
faded bonnet and [plain travelling dress, her eyes
<!-- Leaf 16, Page: 8 -->
drooped, and her arms hanging listlessly by her
sideHer maid was a sober, respectable-looking
Englishwoman of about thirty years of age.


\"Where is the rest of your luggage, my dear ?"
said Miss Atkins, looking at the two feminine trunks
which were strapped down on the roof of the fly.


"That is all that I have—the black one," said
Maddalena. "The other is Mary's."  
  
  
  Miss Atkins opened her eyes.


\"Come in, Maddalena," said Atkins kindly, and
held out his hand. She took it with the tips of her
fingers. When she felt the cold stones of the hall
beneath her, and breathed the musty air of that old
house, a shudder passed over her.


"May I conduct you to your room?" said Miss
Atkins ?  
  
  
  Maddalena bowed and followed her.
In a few moments Miss Atkins returned.


\"Your wife is going to lie down for a little while,"
she said. Then she started.


\"Good God, Richard, how ill you look. Your eyes
are like glass. Have you had any "  
  
  
  " Once."  
  
  
  " Does she know it ?"
<!-- Leaf 17, Page: 9 -->
  
  " No : 1 was away from her at the time."


\"Very well; then she must not. Now I want you
to come with me, and see what I have done."  
  
  
  " But Maddalena


\"She is lying down, I tell you, and does not want
to be disturbed. She almost ordered me out of the
room."


\"Now, I tell you what it is, Jane," said Atkins
savagely, " I won't have any of this."  
  
  
  " Gracious me ! Any of what ?"
\"Why, you have begun already.'  
  
  
  "Begun what, sir? What are you talking of?'


\"Just understand this, Jane, and I tell you once
for all. Maddalena is my wife, and she is the
mistress of my house. If you intend to be rude to her
and plague me, you had better leave it."


\"I shall not wait twice to be asked to leave your
house, Richard," said Jane in a humble voice. " I
am sure that I should never have thought of coming,
only you asked me so kindly, and I saw I might be
of use to you. Now I will go and pack up my things
at once."


\"Who wants you to pack up your things ?" growled
Atkins. " Don't be such a fool, Jane."
<!-- Leaf 18, Page: 10 -->

\"I hope that you wfll find the servants suit you,
Richard. I took great pains to get good ones."  
  
  
  " My dear Jane


\"I fear that I have spent a great deal of money
on the papering, and the fuf—fuf—furniture,
Richard. But I did all for the best, I am sure. I did
not wish her to be discontented directly she came."


Atkins expostulated, but Jane was quite
determined to go. " After all," said she, " it was foolish
in me to come. I have managed your house for you
now so many, many years. I shall be much happier
away."


\"But Maddalena will not want to manage the
house," he replied. " I am sure that she will be very
glad if you will take it off her hands. She has had no
experience in this sort of thing, and I don't think
she has any taste for it either. Indeed, if you like, I
will speak to her about it myself."


So Jane consented to remain, having thus secured
an ally on her side in the combat which she
supposed would soon ensue.


But three days passed, and Maddalena showed no
desire to reign. She answered politely when she was
addressed * but was cold, taciturn, and absent, and
<!-- Leaf 19, Page: 11 -->
seemed to avoidj both her husband and his sister;
wandering about all day as if she was in a dream, or
sitting at the window with her hands folded in her
lap, and her eyes following the clouds.


Miss Atkins, who judged every one by herself,
could not believe that this indifference to power was
real,Tand laid a trap. On the fourth day she came to
her and said :—


\"My dear, I have taken the liberty of keeping
house for you till you had recovered from the fatigue
of your journey. I will now hand over the keys to
their rightful mistress." So saying, she laid in her
lap a small basket containing an enormous bunch of
keys.


Maddalena looked at them in a stupified manner;
then raising her eyes to Miss Atkins' face, saw
immediately how she ought to act. Taking up the
basket she gave it back to her, with a polite speech
in the Itahan manner. Miss Atkins, though she
secretly despised Maddalena for not claiming her
rights, began to like her a little. She testified this
tender feeling by modulations of her voice, by small
attentions, proffered confidences, and gentle looks;
but Maddalena remained always the same—cold,
<!-- Leaf 20, Page: 12 -->
distant, and reserved. Her sister-in-law began to
respect and even to fear her a little. There was
something majestic in the indifference of this young
girl who stood apart from them both, enveloped in
her own thoughts as in a cloud. But soon an
incident occurred which produced a change in her
feelings and behaviour towards the family.


The household was conducted on principles of stern
frugality. One day when the dinner was even plainer
than usual, Miss Atkins offered an apology, which
had the advantage of costing nothing. "You must
find this very humble fare," she said, " after what
you have been accustomed to."


"No, madam," said Maddalena, "till within the
last two years I had been accustomed for a long time
to live like a peasant, upon fruit and polenta, which
is made of Indian corn."


\"You must have suffered great privations after
your father sold his estate," said Atkins.


This word " estate " surprised Maddalena. But she
supposed that it meant the same as " business," and
replied :—" But even before my father's misfortune,
we did not live so very sumptuously. To be sure, as
we kept a boarding-house "
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 13 -->

Atkins supposed that she was alluding to another
period of her reverses. " But the gentry and
nobility?" he asked.


\"Ah ! that is another thing," she said, " If they
are bachelors they usually dine at the restaurant.
And if they have families and live at home—but I
do not know exactly how they live : I have not been
in their society."  
  
  
  " But before your father sold hisestate
\"An estate, sir! what is that ? Do you call a
boarding-house an estate ?"


\"No; this is an estate: a country house and
lands. Your father had one and sold it, did he
not?" said Atkins, rising from his chair in a state
of perturbation.  
  
  
  " Who told you that, sir ?"  
  
  
  " He did."  
  
  
  She turned pale.


\"Then it is not true," she said firmly " Why
should he have wished to deceive you ?" she added,
in a musing tone.


\"He had very good reasons," said Atkins, pacing
up and down the room, his features contracting in a
curious manner.
<!-- Leaf 22, Page: 14 -->

His sister looked at him as if inquiringly, and
also rose. When their eyes met he shook his
head, and said, "No; it is nothing." Maddalena
remembered this afterwards, though, absorbed in
her own thoughts, it made no impression upon her
at the time.


A few moments afterwards he sat down again to
dinner and said,


\"You have not seen your father since we have
been back. Would you like to ?"


\"Yes, sir; and that reminds me I had a letter
from him yesterday, asking me if he could come
down."


\"Good. Write to him and tell him to come
immediately. No; stop. This is Tuesday. Invite him
to come on Saturday."


On Saturday Restoni made his appearance. He
embraced his daughter (before the family) with
effusion. Immediately recognising Miss Atkins'
hostility, and power in her look and tone, he did his
utmost to make himself agreeable to her. After
dinner Maddalena put on her hat and cloak, and
took him out of doors, under the pretence of
showing the grounds. They walked together beneath
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 15 -->
the majestic elms of the park, and along broad walks
between ragged shrubberies.


\"It is a splendid place," exclaimed Restoni; "but
what money will have to be laid out on it! "


\"I do not think Mr. Atkins intends to lay out
much."  
  
  
  " Have you asked him to ?"  
  
  
  " No; I have not asked him for anything;


\"All the better. You will have the more power
for the future."


Maddalena did not reply. He walked beside her
for a little while, plucking leaves and chewing them.
Then he stopped. His face assumed an expression
of mingled irony, cunning, and anxiety.


\"This is a fine country seat," he said; " but it is
not superior to the noble villa which we possessed in
Tuscany."  
  
  
  Maddalena did not answer him.


\"If you recollect, it was built in the Palladian
style, with a grand cortile, marble stairs, superb
columns. We also had an estate of vineyards, olive
orchards, and corn-fields, without mentioning a pine
forest and a mountain."  
  
  
  " Yes," said Maddalena coldly.
<!-- Leaf 24, Page: 16 -->

Restoni continued, his eyes flickering upon her
face as he spoke,—


\"But we were afflicted by a long series of
misfortunes. Harvests failed, fattori embezzled. We
were reduced to a state of ennobled poverty. Finally
you burned to become a singer. Your father
sacrificed everything for you—everything. He sold his
estate. He spent it upon masters. He left himself
nothing."  
  
  
  Maddalena looked at him sternly.  
  
  
  " Well ?" said she.


"When he consented that his daughter should
abandon a profession in which she was amassing a
fortune, he represented these circumstances to her
bridegroom, who gave him a sum of money to
purchase back his lands."  
  
  
  Maddalena looked at him more kindly.


\"And you bought an estate in Tuscany ?" she
asked.


\"Such of course had been my intention; but I
found that the sum which the Signor Atkins had
reluctantly paid was too small for such a purpose.
So I endeavoured to increase it by speculations, and
I regret to say that it has "
<!-- Leaf 25, Page: 17 -->
  
  "What! " cried Maddalena.  
  
  
  " That it has dissolved."


She bit her lips. He placed his hand upon her
shoulder with a soothing gesture; but she shrank
away from him.


\"I deserve that thou shouldst be angry with me,"
he said, gently. " Yet pardon me. I am so
unfortunate. I did all for the best."


\"You have done all for the worst," said
Maddalena bitterly. Then she turned round on him.
\"You want something, or you would not come here.
What is it ? "


\"Simply this. I shall tell thy husband how I
have speculated and lost. I shall ask him to renew
the sum. I do not want any more. I will contrive
to make it enough. Now what thou must do is this.
Thou must beg him to give me the money. Thou
must tell him how painful it is for thee that the
estate of thy forefathers should pass into strange
hands. Thou must pray him to forgive me. Thou
must weep, thou must kneel to him, thou
must "  
  
  
  " Silence !" cried Maddalena.  
  
  
  Restoni looked at her in wonder. She stood in a  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  0
<!-- Leaf 26, Page: 18 -->
haughty, almost threatening attitude, before him,
her eyes flashing with rage and scorn.


\"My husband knows everything," she said. " I
have told him what we are, and from what we
were."


\"Diavolo ! " muttered Restoni. " Why did I not
forewarn her?"


\"Forewarn me ! You think, then, that I would
have been your tool ? No, no, sir; you have done
enough. You have destroyed my happiness in this
life, but you shall not destroy it in the next. You
shall not make me a thief."


\"Calm thyself, dearest; who wishes to make thee
a thief?"  
  
  
  " You, who are one yourself, unhappy man."


\"Then let us give up this tale of the estate. Let
us confess everything (since everything is known).
Ask him only "


\"I will ask him for nothing. You ordered me to
marry this man, and I obeyed you. You had made
me swear an oath, and I was forced to obey. I
married him, and you received the price which you
had set upon my life. Now I am his—his, do you
hear ?—I am branded with his name, as his
<!-- Leaf 27, Page: 19 -->
sheepand cattle are; you have sold me to him; he has
paid for me; and I am his."  
  
  
  " But, Maddalena, for thyfather" I have no father now."


Restoni bent his head. Maddalena turned back
towards the house; he followed at her heels like
a dog. He was stupified. Was this cold, severe
woman the affectionate and tender girl whom he
had parted from only a few weeks before ? Then she
had been ductile as gold between his hands : now
she was a weapon of sharp, hard steel, which he had
laid hold of by the blade.


He suffered that punishment which ought to fall
upon all parents who make their daughters marry
against their will. In Italy, and in France, it is
almost a custom, and society offers its distractions
to the wife. But in domestic England it is a worse
vice, for its victim suffers more. She sees herself
encircled by those who have married because they
loved : she is taunted by their happiness: and she
is condemned to a fife of seclusion, which, with
love, is a Home, but which without is a Hell.


During the honeymoon of a mariage de
convenance a girl's character undergoes a great change.  
  
  
  o 2
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 20 -->
She hates alike the parents who have bartered her
away and the man who has purchased her with
his money or his name. She becomes bitter and
sullen in mind; while her heart slowly hardens in
the black frost which has withered up all the flowers
of her life. Then, sooner or later, she acquires the
hypocrisy of the courtesan. She learns to yield
herself up with smiles, to invent false caresses, to simulate
passion in her hated husband's arms. If she has a
child she may be saved. Her affections concentrate
themselves into maternal love. But if not, there
may come a day when her parents shall suffer from
a shame of which they have been the only cause.


Every woman of delicate feelings will understand
that Maddalena, since her marriage, had suffered
tortures which were worse to her than death. This
will explain her conduct towards her husband and
her sister-in-law; and during the last two or three
days she had been reflecting on her father's
falsehood. She had looked back into her past life, and
a film had fallen from her eyes. By a flash of
thought, livid, luminous, and forked, the black mind
of her father had been made to her as clear as day.
She saw why he had made her take the oath; why
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 21 -->
he had gratified her desire to go upon the stage.
Though she could not divine the elaborate plot of
which she had been the victim, she suspected that
he had purposely brought about the quarrel with
Eugenio. At all events, she saw that her lover had
only spoken the truth. She had long known that
her father was a drunkard. She had now discovered
that he was a thief. Restoni's vices had parted her
from him. This last reflection was the bitterest of
all. It made her absolutely hate her father.


She preceded him to the dining-room. The others
were still there. They sat down at the huge oak
table. Restoni stood before them, like a criminal
before three judges. Atkins and his sister were both
embarassed. Maddalena was pale but calm.


\"Jacopo Restoni," she said, " I declare that the
pretext under which you obtained money from my
husband was false. I deny all previous knowledge
of your base and dishonest schemes, and before these
witnesses I renounce you as my father."


Restoni looked at her stupidly. Miss Atkins gave
a slight exclamation. Her brother nervously cleared
his throat.  
  
  
  " Mr. Restoni," he said, " you've had a large sum
<!-- Leaf 30, Page: 22 -->
of money from me. It's useless just now discussing
how you got it; but where's it gone to ? That's
what I want to know."  
  
  
  " I regret to say that I have been speculating—
\"In what ? " said Atkins, pricking up his ears.  
  
  
  " On the Stock Exchange," said Restoni, vaguely.
Atkins gave a dry smile.


"Not much doing on 'Change in August. What
could it have been in ? Let me see. What was the
last smash ? Was it Russian bonds ?"


"Yes; that was it," cried Restoni, falling headlong
into the trap. " Ah, those cursed bonds !"  
  
  
  Atkins looked at a printed list among his

papers.


\"Ah, I see I have been mistaken. Russian bonds
are at 90. Try again."


Restoni saw that he was attempting to grapple
with a giant. He was out of his element. He said
no more.


\"If you wish us to help you, you had better tell
the truth," said Atkins.


\"Yes; do tell the truth, Mr. Restoni," said Miss
Atkins.  
  
  
  Restoni was rapidly combining the ideas, which
<!-- Leaf 31, Page: 23 -->
were pouring out of his productive brain, when
Atkins moved again.


\"Allow me to assist your memory," he said,
sorting his papers with a skilful hand. " I have letters
here from London and Paris, where I find you have
been speculating on a small scale. Do you remember
the Rue, Mr. Restoni ?"


By going up to London, and making diligent
inquiries, Atkins had managed in three days to lay
hold of his clue, and had received one or two letters
from Paris. The rest of the documents were
"quakers." Restoni supposed that the whole pile
consisted of evidence against him, so he gave in at
once.


On receiving his money he had paid the sporting
debts which excluded him from the turf, and went
over to Paris. There his thirst for play brought him
into contact with a gang of gentlemanly sharpers,
who cleared him out. However, besides the large
sums which he had lost at ecarte', he had lived in the
most prodigal manner, supposing (this he did not
confess) that he was enjoying the first golden egg out
of a large nest.  
  
  
  " Well, sir," said Atkins, " and what do you wish
<!-- Leaf 32, Page: 24 -->
us to do for you now ? Do you consider that you
have any further claims on us ?"


\"Yes, I do," cried Restoni. " If my daughter had
remained single she would have been making money,
and she would have fed and clothed me, Isuppose.  
  
  
  Atkins turned to his wife.  
  
  
  " Will you decide for me, Maddalena ?


\"I have no right to decide for you, sir, she replied
haughtily; "and I must decline to do so. If you
think that you ought to give him more money, give
it him. If you think that you have done all that
your duty requires, send him away."


Restoni looked at her—such a look—and turned
to go. Her lips trembled, but she did not speak.


\"Stop a moment, sir; stop a moment," said
Atkins hurriedly. " I wish to do what is right.
Maddalena, what I have is yours. Give him just
what you please."


\"I thank you, sir," she said, in a cold and bitter
tone; " but I cannot interfere. It is purely a matter
of business. You received me from the Signor
Restoni, and you gave him what he asked."  
  
  
  " But supposing that you were still supporting
<!-- Leaf 33, Page: 25 -->
your father, and he had served you as he ha6 served
me, what would you do ?"


"I would certainly not pander to his vices. I
would, as he has said, feed and clothe him—but no
more."


Atkins wrote a letter. " Take this," he said, " to
the address. It is my lawyer's. He will tell you
when and how you will receive your money. It is a
life annuity of a hundred pounds, to be paid quarterly
in advance, and to be increased if Mrs. Atkins at any
time desires it."


Restoni bowed. The brother and sister quickly
left the room. Maddalena remained, with her eyes
fixed moodily upon the floor.


"My daughter," said the old man in a tender
voice, " thou art changed."


\"Yes," she said, " and you are the cause of it.
You have bargained away my life—for what ? A
few hours of excitement in a hell. Every moment
of my existence here is an agony. And it is you
to whom I owe this. But why do you stay ? You
have got what you came for; you have your money.
Go, sir, go."  
  
  
  " And art thou unhappy ?" he murmured softly.
<!-- Leaf 34, Page: 26 -->
"Poor child. Maddalena," he whispered, "wilt
thou come with me and share the little that I
have ? We11 shall be poor, but we shall be

together."


She turned her eyes full on his face. " Yes," she
said with a sneer, " we shall be together, shall we
not ? and we can escape to the continent from my
master who has bought me, and we can go to Vienna,
and I can take an engagement and gain a large
salary for you to spend on your dear cards again.
Oh, my beloved father, I understand what affection
you have for me now. It is my voice you love—as
others did; there are none who love poor Maddalena
for herself. Do not stay, then, I tell you. There is
no more money for you here."


Restoni looked at her with a gentle and sorrowful
air. " I deserve this," he said, " and I am punished
rightly. Then yielding to an impulse of affection
and repentance, which the worst men feel at least
once in their lives, he knelt down before his daughter
and said, " Maddalena, I promise thee that in thy
presence I will never speak of money again. I will
try to lead a good life. If Mr. Atkins will help me
I will enter, a commercial house. But before
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 27 -->
I go, place thy hands upon my head and say in thy
own sweet voice, Father, I forgive thee."


Her heart began to melt: she slowly raised her
hands, when her eye caught sight of a mosaic pin in
his scarf. It was like one which Eugenio used to
wear. She sprang back from him and cried, "No,
no. I cannot forgive you. I will never forgive you
all my fife."


He rose, his face black with passion. " You will
not forgive me, eh ? Well, some day you will find
it difficult to forgive yourself. You will not pander
to my vices, you said just now ? Well, we shall see.
As for your purse-proud Englishman, I will teach
him that a Restoni is not to be insulted."


This reduced boarding-house keeper, by repeating
always the same tale, had almost persuaded himself
that it was true, and really felt at that moment the
rage of an offended noble. He bowed to Maddalena
with dignity, and said, " Signora, you are my
daughter; I pardon you," and he strode haughtily
from the room.


This scene, which to spectator would have been
ludicrous, was terrible for Maddalena. She went
upstairs to her dressing-room; she had furnished it
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 28 -->
herself with a little bed, a toilette-table, a cottage
piano, a book-case, a round table, and two chairs.
Over the fire-place hung her picture of the Madonna
of the Seven Dolors. In a corner of the room was a
silver crucifix, and beneath it a cushion. This was
her sanctum. Here she sang and prayed. Here
alone she enjoyed peace; her husband respected the
privacy of this apartment; her sister-in-law shunned
it as a kind of pagan shrine.


She went immediately to the window and opened
the casement. She saw her father but a little way
off, walking down the avenue, clenching his hands.
She tried to call him, but her voice only whispered;
she waved her handkerchief, but he did not look
round; she flung herself upon the bed, sobbing
bitterly, with her head upon her arm.


When this paroxysm had passed away, she thought
over the scene which had just passed, and shuddered
with horror at herself. She gazed with frightened
eyes into the abysses of her own heart. She did
not reproach herself with what she had done, but
with the manner in which it had been done. Could
she not have refused to become his accomplice
without so bitterly accusing and renouncing him in
<!-- Leaf 37, Page: 29 -->
public ? Had she not done wrong in refusing to
forgive him ? She confessed to herself that she had
been influenced less by honesty than by motives
of a selfish pride. She had wished to show these
people that she was different from him; that if he
was base, she was pure: and so instead of acting
as mediator between her father and her husband,
she had played the part of a public accuser, hired
by her own vanity. She had poured out upon him
all the gall that had been accumulating within her
since the day of her unhappy marriage. But most
of all did she blame herself for her last outburst of
passion. Why had she refused to forgive him ? She
felt her cheeks redden when she thought of this. It
was because he had made her give up Eugenio. But
was it just to blame him for that ? Had he not
proved that Eugenio was unworthy of her; that he
had deceived her, and laughed at her to another
woman ? She had the right to reproach her father
with this marriage, but for the rupture which had
occasioned it, ought she not to thank him ? But no;
the more she thought and analysed her thought, the
longer she knelt at this stern self-confessional, the
more alarmed she became at the state which her
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 30 -->
mind was in. She found that she could pardon her
father more readily for having swindled her husband
than for having exposed to her Eugenio's deceit.
Ah, what a strange thing is a woman's heart ! How
it defies and struggles with and stifles her poor
weak brain ! In the midst of her contrition she
began to yearn that it had been Eugenio who had
knelt before her, and implored her to forgive him.
She hated herself; she fought with herself; she
yearned to scourge herself that she might exercise
by pain that sinful and delicious thought. Then
she knelt before the sad and tortured Mother, and
prayed to her for help. Those gentle eyes did not
look down on her in vain. For her a spirit dwelt
beneath the paint, unseen but not unfelt. They
soothed her and consoled her: her grief abated as
the waves fall when the sirocco folds its wings. She
drank in draughts of heaven from those eyes. They
resembled those of the Madonna of the Shrine.
Sometimes this resemblance troubled her; she
would be reminded of the oath which she had taken,
and which was partly the cause of her unhappy life.
But this time, if the memories were sad, it was a
sadness so tender and so subdued that it was sweeter
<!-- Leaf 39, Page: 31 -->
than a joy. She thought of her girlhood and her
dreams of art. Once more she was in the little
cottage on the hill; and Florence lay smiling in the
vale beneath, and the golden sun was sinking in
the sky, and the air was perfumed with the essence
of the earth. Above her was Mary, the goddess of
her early youth. Then closing her eyes that the
vision might not fade, she sang—  
  
  
  
"Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum; benedicta tu inter
mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Jesus. Sancta
Maria, mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus nunc et in hora
mortis nostræ. Amen."


She passed some time in a state of languor,
ineffable but calm, resembling that which succeeds
a physical turbulence of sense, whether excited by
pleasure or by pain. She determined to subdue her
pride. She would write humbly to her father. She
would try and be a good wife. She would no longer
reject the proffered kindness of her husband's sister.
Was it their fault that she had been wretched ? If
she could not love her husband, at least she might
make him her friend.


She sat down to the table and wrote as
follows :—
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 32 -->

\"My dearest Father,—To-day you did not know
your little Maddalena. Misfortune has hardened
her, maddened her; but never mind, dearest, she is
going to be very happy. Her husband and her
sister are very kind, and they will quite cure her
poor little wounded heart. But you must send
your medicine too, you know. You must write at
once and assure her that you have forgotten all the
naughty things she said to-day. And then you must
make me a promise as well. Promise me that you
will give up cards and something else. You know,
dearest, what I mean. I had no tender eyes for
you to-day, but I saw that you were looking very
ill, and that 3*our hand trembled in a strange

way.


\"Now it is my turn to promise something. Live
quietly for a year; come and see us sometimes; and
then I will put away all my pride and ask Mr.
Atkins to give you some more money. Would you
like to live at home and have a villa ? Well, we
shall see. Only write at once to your little
Maddalena; tell her that you have really forgiven her, and
that you are going to be good, and she will believe
you with all her heart."
<!-- Leaf 41, Page: 33 -->

She signed this, in the English manner, Your
affectionate and dutiful daughter, addressed it to
him at the lawyer's, and put it in the bag herself.
No answer came, and she suffered that punishment
which, sooner or later, we receive from ourselves for
all the faults which we commit. On this occasion,
the instrument of Fate was Miss Jane Atkins. It
was her habit to scrutinise all letters before they
left the house, and this one she carried to the
stillroom, where she applied it to the steam which
proceeded from the spout of a tea-kettle. This melted
the gum of the adhesive envelope, so that she could
open it without difficulty. She kept it past
posttime, that she might think it over, and came to the
conclusion that if the letter was sent, a good
morning's work would be completely spoilt. A hundred
a-year was a handsome allowance, and Restoni no
doubt would be content to live on it, if not unsettled
by the hope of getting more. As for the villa scheme,
she disapproved of it entirely. Had the letter been
sent, it might have changed the current of this story;
but it went to ashes in a bed-room candlestick.


Maddalena was miserable enough after this event.
She was continually haunted by those words: You  
  
  
  VuL. II.  
  
  
  D
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 34 -->
will not pander to my vices. Well, we shall see.
The vague threat which he had uttered against her
husband made her fear that he would commit—what
she could not guess; but something that was
dangerous and bad. She was in an eternal state of
suspense and fear; often thinking that she heard
steps outside the house, or on the stairs, she would
steal from her husband's side to the window or the
door. But from that day she changed in her
behaviour to Richard and Jane Atkins. She became
gentle, assiduous, almost affectionate. Her husband
was really fond of her, and seemed so grateful to her
for these little attentions, that she reproached herself
for her previous conduct again and again.


It would perhaps have been better for
Maddalena's peace of mind had she continued to keep Jane
Atkins at a distance. This woman might have hated,
but she would have respected her. As it was, she
began to like her; and the fondness of such people is
perilous, because it is based only on selfishness of
the most sordid kind. Maddalena had flattered her
small mind by ceding to her the dominion of the
household, and by the manner in which she had
mentioned her in the letter to Restoni. On finding*
<!-- Leaf 43, Page: 35 -->
that Maddalena no longer repelled her advances, she
wound herself closer and closer round her every day.
But her flattered vanity required continual food.
Ambition is as frequently found in the circle of
domestic life, as in those of the outer world; the
divine infernal passion which expands the breast of
a Napoleon may desolate a continent and shake a
world; the petty hankering after power which
torments a Jane Atkins may ruin a family and lay
waste a heart. The difference is only in degree.


Jane was not contented when she found that she
could rule over her brother's household; she wished
to rule over her brother's wife. She desired to direct
all her actions; she was jealous of every thought
and of every pleasure which Maddalena did not share
with her. She was anxious that Maddalena should
suffer from every annoyance with which she was
troubled. And so Maddalena fell under the family
tyranny, which is of all the worst, because it adopts
the mask of affection, and opposes every struggle for
liberty with tears and reproaches of unrequited
love.


Maddalena was indifferent, and therefore pliable.
The trifles which make up the lives of so many  
  
  
  D 2
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 36 -->
women were nothing to her. She ate and drank what
Jane thought was best for her health; sTie suffered
herself to be instructed in plain needlework; she
read, or pretended to read, the books which Jane
gave her; she played, from a chapel hymn-book, the
tunes which Jane liked; and dressed in the manner
which Jane thought most becoming. All this
involved an amount of small hypocrisy which would
have been painful to a man, but which cost women
nothing. However, Maddalena was rapidly losing
her liberty; she found it difficult to escape to the
solitude of her little room; where she could indulge
in reveries and prayers, and where she could play and
sing the music which she loved. Jane, although
she had never yet entered the room, had very
frequently tapped at the door.


Cloyed like a Lothario with easy conquests, Miss
Atkins longed for something which would offer
obstacles to her desires. Then she was seized with
a grand idea,—she would convert Maddalena to the
Protestant religion.


In order to prepare the way, she redoubled her
attentions to Maddalena; she spoke to her always
in a tender pathetic tone of voice; she talked to her
<!-- Leaf 45, Page: 37 -->
about Restoni, whom she pitied and praised; she
bedaubed her with nauseous flatteries, like the
serpent, which covers with saliva the victim which
it is about to devour. But, sometimes unable to
entirely subdue the real petulance and peevishness
of her nature, she would put out her claws as if in
spite of herself, and when she felt lonely, would chide
Maddalena for having deprived her of society.


I have already observed that Miss Atkins, although
parsimonious and severe, was by no means indifferent
to the company of her fellow creatures. In London
she had been in the habit of moving in a large and
busy circle of serious friends. On coming to Vachell
she had raised her eyes to county society. She had
resolved that her brother should neglect nothing to
make himself popular. The rector had called upon
them, had spoken to them about his parish, and had
shown them over the church. There was no
dissenting chapel in the neighbourhood, and it never entered
the reverend gentleman's head that the new squire
could belong to any church but that which had been
established by the state. The Atkinses did not
undeceive him; when they saw the immense pew beneath
the pulpit, where they would be enthroned as the
<!-- Leaf 46, Page: 38 -->
patrons of the parish; when they saw how
completely they would lose the respect of the pastor of
their tenants, and probably of all their neighbours,
by refusing to go to church, they wisely abandoned
their scruples and became Anglicans. The
prayerbook puzzled them sadly at first, and their first
sacrament was very trying, but they came through
the ordeal in triumph. The rector little suspected
that they had never been held over a font. She also
made her brother buy a carriage and a pair of horses,
—a carriage, which in London is a luxury, is a
necessary in the country. In this they drove into the
town on afternoons. She made him subscribe to
the Hunt and various other local funds. Their
arrival in the county having thus been advertised,
she would spend her afternoons at the drawing-room
windows waiting for visitors to appear. But none
came. Whenever a carriage appeared, which was
but rarely, it turned off at the lodge gate on the
Reading or Oxford road, having made her heart beat
high in vain. September brought all the gentry
down into the country. She could hear their guns
popping in every direction; they followed their birds
into the Vachell turnips, but they did not deign to
<!-- Leaf 47, Page: 39 -->
call at the house. Jane Atkins lost her temper
under all these trials; she reproached her brother
for having married a singer.


\"What is the consequence ? " she cried; " you have
shut yourself out of all decent society. You have
spent fifty pounds on a pack of dogs and red-jackets,
and have made yourself ridiculous in a hundred
other ways."


But when she insinuated to Maddalena that her
profession had caused them to be tabooed, the former
replied haughtily,


\"You are mistaken, madam; there'must be some
other reason. In this very county a gentleman of
property married a lady who was originally a singer.
She is a leader of fashion, not only in the county but
in the best society of London; and I might mention
other instances."


Jane did not reply; she liked her none the better
for this retort, and it was with some difficulty that
Maddalena healed the wound which she had inflicted
on her vanity. Miss Atkins had one of those
unhealthy minds in which every scratch festers.


She was, however, convinced that she had been
mistaken, and at length she determined to speak
<!-- Leaf 48, Page: 40 -->
with the rector on the subject. This good man,
who had been questioned by the neighbouring squires
about the Vachell people, and who was in their
confidence, replied,


\"Well, you see, madam, all the gentry round here
are Tories, and your husband was once a Liberal
member. In these parts they are very hot about
politics."  
  
  
  Jane returned and ridiculed her brother for his

Parliamentary ambition, to which she traced all the
calamities of his life. " But if that is all," she said,
"we will make them come round. Next time you
shall vote for the Tories."  
  
  
  Atkins shook his head.


\"They won't wantjny vote," he said. " They have
returned three Conservatives in this county the last
two elections without any opposition at all. Besides,
Parliament is not likely to be dissolved for two years
yet to come."


She had a last hope. " All the proprietors round
here are magistrates," she said, "and
deputy-lieutenants, too." Some of them have less land than you.
You must get put on the commission; you will sit at
the same table with a dozen of your neighbours twice
<!-- Leaf 49, Page: 41 -->
a month, besides meeting all the people of the
county at the Quarter Sessions and the Grand
Assizes. If you have any tact at all, you cannot fail
to make some acquaintances."


Atkins wrote to the Lord-Lieutenant, whose
secretary replied that he would be appointed a Justice of
the Peace if he would forward a petition, signed by
the neighbouring gentry, to the effect that a
magistrate was required in that district. The fact was
that Atkins had bought himself into an exclusive
neighbourhood. There were many parts of
England where he would have found himself in his own
element—a commercial aristocracy. But this
district of Oxfordshire had been disfigured and enriched
by no railways, mines, or manufactures. It
wasinhabited by the genuine country gentry, a race
which in England is slowly dying out. Their
escutcheons were stained by no base and moneyed
alliances; with bluer blood in their veins than
threefourths of the titled families in England, they lived
in their ancient manor-houses, and ruled over a
peasantry who still preserved for them the faith of
the feudal ages. But still their power was ebbing
away. Many of them were poorer than their
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 42 -->
tenantfarmers; but still they strove to preserve their
prestige as they had preserved their pride; and
maintained the majesty of monarchs though fallen from
their thrones.


And well might they be proud. The
moneymongers may pretend to despise ancient and
honourable birth, but it is one of those few things which
they cannot buy. They can purchase titles, lands,
seats in the House of Commons, beautiful and
highborn wives; but they cannot purchase that pleasure
which is one of the noblest that a man can
enjoy.


Who can walk in an ancient room and look up
at the pictures of his ancestors upon the walls
—or read their names in old chronicles or
timestained tablets, or scratched with a diamond upon a
pane of antique glass—or walk under the immense
trees which they planted, or pore over the parchment
letters which they wrote long ago—or receive the
blessing of some retainer grown grey in the service
of the house, without feeling his breast swell, and his
eyes fill ? If a man has a grain of good in his
nature, this will make it germinate within him. He
will strive to add honour to an honoured name, to
<!-- Leaf 51, Page: 43 -->
restore the fortunes of his family if it be fallen, to
maintain them if it be high.


Well, these Oxfordshire codini regarded the
intruder with a feeling of dislike and almost of fear.
They regarded him as the first of a race who,
wielding golden weapons, would drive their sons or their
grandsons from their native soil. Besides, they could
not afford to entertain as he would entertain; they
felt no desire to be outshone. So they passed with a
sigh the house where the Vachells had once lived,
and which still bore, as if in mockery, their name.


Thus the Atkinses were thrown entirely upon
clergymen and gentlemen farmers for their society.
The latter class Miss Atkins disclaimed; and she
derived little pleasure from the country curates with
their huge appetites and penchant for athletic sports,
and their distaste for religion on week-days. She
had her household, her poultry, and her kitchen
garden, and Maddalena's soul to look after, and thus
her time was tolerably well filled up. But Atkins,
who had always led so industrious a life, began to
suffer from the want of an occupation. When he
had finished the " Dog Star " in the morning, he was
at a loss how to pass the time. He was fond of his
<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 44 -->
wife, and she considered it her duty to amuse him;
but what could she do ? There was not a subject in
common between them. There was not a topic on
which they could converse. He thought that he
would like to farm. Every Cockney supposes that he
can jump into a knowledge of farming—the mere
elements of which are scarcely to be mastered in a
lifetime. Luckily for his pocket the lease of his own
lands had five years to run, and there was no farm
tobe let near Vachell. Since he knew nothing of field
sports, never read books, and did not care for music,
—since, in fact, like many men of business, he had
neither tastes nor acquirements, he was forced to
saunter about the grounds with his hands in his
pockets, and his head crouched between his
shoulders. Soon his health became visibly impaired; even
the country people remarked the strangeness of his
aspect; his fixed glassy eyes, his puffed-out, bloated
face, and a peculiarity in his gait.


In the meantime Miss Atkins had opened the
campaign. At first she had asked Maddalena to
read with her portions of the Bible, and had been
astonished when she immediately acquiesced.
Ignorant as most Protestants, she had believed that the
<!-- Leaf 53, Page: 45 -->
Bible is withheld from all Catholics by the priests,
and was astonished when she heard that a
translation is circulated in Italy under the authority of the
Church. She was also surprised when Maddalena
consented to attend service regularly in the parish
church. But Maddalena's first visit had dissipated
any scruple which she could have had. She found
that the Common Prayer-Book was little else than
an abbreviation of the missal; that instead of an
altar there was a table; instead of fine music to good
Latin, indifferent tunes to a parody of the Psalms;
that it was in fact the Catholic service in a distorted
and incomplete form; and that the parish church
bore much the same relation to a Catholic cathedral
as a brick house to a Gothic palace.


Miss Atkins then discoursed long and earnestly
upon the false doctrines of the Papistry, and the
abominations of the " Scarlet Lady." She attempted
to prove to Maddalena that she was an idolatress,
and could not possibly be saved unless she "turned."
She assailed her with controversial works from
N-jsbet's; gave her Fox's Book of Martyrs, and a history
of the Reformation. To these she added those little
tracts which contain the confessions of escaped nuns
<!-- Leaf 54, Page: 46 -->
&c, and are filled with obscenities which would be
tolerated in no other publication.


All this, without convincing Maddalena, disturbed
her peace of mind. Religion, her best consolation
in her wretched life, became a source of fresh
anxiety and trouble. Her faith was shaken, though
it was not overthrown.


At this crisis she received a letter, which she
gave to her husband to read. It was from
Darlington, who informed her that he was examining the
sanitary arrangements of villages in the country; he
was about to visit that part of Oxfordshire; would
her husband afford him some assistance ? After a
little discussion between Atkins and his sister, it
was arranged that the Doctor should be invited to
Vachell Court; and in a few days he came.


Atkins was glad of this visit, which lasted three
days. It occupied him. He and Maddalena, with
the steward, accompanied Darlington over the thirty
cottages on the estate. The Doctor then began
to understand why rheumatism attacks labourers
almost without exception. They found holes in
the roofs through which the rain dripped upon the
beds. They found chinks in the walls through which
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 47 -->
one could look out on the landscape, and through which
the winter winds blew in. The windows were only
half of glass; the other panes were filled with brown
paper and rags. Sometimes there were chasms in
the bed-room floors from a missing plank, which
endangered the lives of the children in the house.
This state of thing is very common in the
agricultural districts. It is explained by the word repairs,
of which landlords have such terror. These cottages
with their petty rents cost more than they bring in
a steward in his master's interest does not
recommend repairs till economy demands it; the house is
patched up only to save the expense of rebuilding:
till that period arrives the health of the inmate
suffers. Atkins, like most landlords, especially the
new ones, had never seen a cottage bed-room; he
was shocked, and gave liberal orders to the steward,
who was surprised that flesh and blood should be
considered in an affair of bricks and mortar. So
were the cottagers themselves, who, having for the
first time found some one to listen to their real
grievances, began directly to fabricate false ones.
Darlington asked Maddalena if she had been in the
habit of visiting the tenants. She had never thought
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 48 -->
of doing so. He told her that she ought to teach in
the school sometimes, and to go round to all the
cottages, comfort those who had troubles, and take
little dainties to those who were sick. She was
delighted to find that she could do good; she made
in his company a tour of charity; she found that she
could delight the old dames of the village if she
would consent to listen to them; and if she would
read the Bible to them now and then; and
sometimes, to those that were sickly, send down a little
broth or beef-tea from the " Great House."
Darlington gave her some recipes and useful hints, and
the titles of some books on nursing and domestic
medicine. As he was about to go, Maddalena made
him walk with her in the garden, and confided to
him her troubles about religion, and the persecution
she suffered from her sister-in-law.


Darlington did not reply for some time. Then he
said:—


\"My dear girl, I see that this lady's arguments
have made you doubt. But have they drawn you
-towards her own religion ?"


"No, no," said Maddalena. "If this goes on I
might cease to be Catholic, but I could never become
<!-- Leaf 57, Page: 49 -->
a Protestant. How can I cling to a branch when I
desert the tree ? Sometimes I think for a little
while that I have been brought up to believe in a
corrupted creed. But soon all my faith pours back
upon me. I pity poor Jane who does not believe in
the Holy Virgin, and I kneel down and pray for her."


Darlington smiled at the idea of both these
women praying for each other. But he soon
became serious again. " Do not be troubled," he
said, " about what Miss Atkins says. She says that
your ceremonies have been copied from the Pagans.
But baptism' and confirmation, the doctrines of
the Trinity, of heaven and hell, were originally
Pagan. She says that your priests massacred
Protestants : she has related to you the horrors of the
Inquisition. But in those days the Protestants
perpetrated similar atrocities. However, in order to
argue with her on an equal footing, you would have
to study a library of works which your Church has
published. But this would be a tedious and not
very elevating study. All controversy is a
profanation of religion."  
  
  
  "What shall I do then ?" Doctor.  
  
  
  " Refuse to listen to her. Be gentle, but be firm.  
  
  
  VOL. II. B
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 50 -->
Tell her as you have told me, that you can
neverbecome a Protestant, and request her never to speak
to you of these things again."  
  
  
  " I fear that she will hate me."


\"Which is better, that she should hate you, or that
you should despise yourself ?"


\"I will do as you advise me. But what are you,
my friend—you are not a Protestant ?"  
  
  
  " No, I am not a Protestant."


"Then you are a Catholic," cried Maddalena,
clapping her hands.


Darlington smiled. " What I am," he said, " you
could not understand now. You must be contented

to know that I have a religion, and that I have
suffered for it. Now let us go in."


The next day was a Friday. Maddalena
refused as usual to touch meat. Miss Atkins
pressed her to break through her rule.
Maddalena said that she could not do so without a
dispensation.


Jane ridiculed her, and asked why. Maddalena
replied that the Catholic Church had ordained
Friday as a fast because our Lord had been
crucified on that day. The English Church, she said,
<!-- Leaf 59, Page: 51 -->
keeps this fast once a year; but we keep it once a
week."


Jane Atkins became satirical, in a weak and bitter
way. Leaving the question of Friday and fasting
she ran over the whole gamut of Protestant
polemics; and at last became abusive, and, as Maddalena
considered, blasphemous.


She became pale, and said : " Jane, I have
determined to hear no more of this. I shall never become a
Protestant; and I shall listen to you no more. Never
speak to me of these things again."


"But I must speak of them," cried Jane. "I
shall be held responsible for your immortal soul, if
I do not try to save it before it is too late."


\"You have nothing to do with my soul," said
Maddalena, angrily, " and I will thank you to mind
your own business."


\"My dear Maddalena!" cried Atkins, who was
getting very much excited.


\"Never mind, Richard, never mind," said Jane,
weeping, " I will bear anything for the Lord's sake."


\"Mr. Atkins," said Maddalena, coldly, " you know
the stipulations under which the Father married us:
I was to be free to exercise my own religion without  
  
  
  E 2
<!-- Leaf 60, Page: 52 -->
opposition; and the children, if we had any, were to
be brought up in the same faith."


\"Oh, Richard, Richard ! " cried his sister, " you
have bartered away your children's souls."


\"He would not marry us without, my dear," was
Richard's weak apology. "They always stipulate
for that."


\"You will therefore have the kindness to tell your
sister to leave me alone about my religion. I have
no objection to go to your Church, and to teach
the children in the school what you please. I do
not think that is wrong. Dr. Darlington did not
think it was. But he said that the Protestants
were quite as bad as the Catholics had ever been."


Miss Atkins dried her eyes and gave a malicious
smile.  
  
  
  " Oh, now I understand," said she.  
  
  
  " What do you understand ?" said Maddalena.


\"I suppose that was what you hid yourself in the
shrubbery to talk about."


\"We did not hide ourselves in the shrubbery that
I am aware of," said Maddalena, whose eyes began
to flash; " we went there to talk about the
persecutions I have received from you—that was all."
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 53 -->

\"You are not aware, perhaps, that I could see you
all the while from my window ?"


\"As we did not wish to hide ourselves, we did not
care whether you chose to play the spy on us or
not."


Atkins was pacing quickly up and down the
room, sometimes vainly trying to soothe the
combatants.  
  
  
  " I saw your tender parting," said Jane  
  
  
  " What do you mean, madam ?"


"I need not explain to you what you already
know, but I shall tell my brother what sort of a
woman he has married."  
  
  
  Maddalena was speechless from astonishment and

rage.


"What do you think, Richard, of a wife who
brings her lover down here under the ridiculous
pretence of inspecting cottages, and who takes long
walks with him under the pretence of charity, and
lets him kiss her in the shrubbery under the
pretence of religion ?"


Maddalena sprang up and said, " Mr. Atkins,
aftersuch an insult, such a calumny as this, either your
sister or I must leave the house. I would rather
<!-- Leaf 62, Page: 54 -->
that I left it, if you please, for I am not happy here,
and I can get my own living on the stage."


But Atkins's eyes were fixed on the opposite
wall. His lips were blue; his face expressed agony
and fear: he slowly raised his hand and pointed
at something before him. " It is coming," he said.


\"Leave the room, I implore you ! " cried Jane to
Maddalena. Then seeing that she was too stupefied
to move, she seized her round the waist with a pair
of thin but sinewy arms, carried her bodily out
of the room, set her down in the hall, saying,
\"For God's sake go to your own room," cried out
in a shrill voice, "John, the ice !" and ran back.


Maddalena went to her little room. A quarter of
an hour afterwards she heard her husband enter his

chamber accompanied by Jane and the butler. She
slipped down to the dining-room, hoping to find
there some explanation of this extraordinary scene.
She noticed nothing at first, but as she was going
away her eye caught sight of a stain upon the
carpet close to the place where Atkins had sat.
She stooped down and examined it closely. It
was blood !

  CHAPTER II.


Baden-Baden is a paradise, and a description of
it always resembles a prospectus. It is certainly
one of the most beautiful places in the world. It
nestles, in a miniature valley, watered by the
sparkling little Oos, perfumed by meadows, which are
almost gardens, shaded by groves and avenues of
stately elms, and encircled by lofty forest-covered
hills. Anywhere else these would be the cause of
eternal rain; but here, though they attract the
clouds, the winds are ingeniously arranged to drive
them instantly away. Showers are frequent, storms
are rare * the climate is a constant ApriL Nature
comes with a watering-pot and sprinkles the trees
and flowers every day.


Baden has the size and rural aspect of a village,
but the population of a large town. At certain
hours the promenades display a crowd which rivals
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 56 -->
those of Hyde Park or the Bois de Boulogne. The
stranger looks down at a cluster of houses, and
wonders where all these people sleep. The mystery
is explained by the number and magnitude of the
hotels, where visitors are packed like soldiers in a
barrack. The world proper of Baden is supplied
from the Faubourg St. Germain and Belgravia, from
Bloomsbury and the Chausse"e d'Antin. Its world
improper is less numerous than at Hombourg
and Wiesbaden, and has an elegance and splendour
of its own. Here one comes in contact with the
cream of vice, there only with its scum. Here
the escroc plays in kid gloves, there his hands are
bare and usually unwashed. Here a duchess may
get ideas from the dress of a lorette; there she
blazes in loud colours, and wears coarse rouge upon
her cheeks. Baden-Baden is a lady; her sisters are
bourgeoises and snobs.


From all parts of the town there may be seen a
large white building, with a portico in the style of
the Renaissance, supported by eight yellow columns.
It stands on the top of a gently sloping hill, laid out
in grass-plots and flower-beds; lined with shops
which are scarcely larger than booths at a fair, but
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 57 -->
which glitter with the wealth of the Bouvelards,
and which are stored with the treasures of local
produce, such as the toys of Nuremberg, the
cuckooclocks of the Black Forest, and the woollen goods of
Saxony. On the front of the white building is
printed in large letters the word Conversation.
You cross a broad gravel walk where the world
promenades, while music is played to them from a
gold and green kiosque; you mount into the portico,
and pass into the grand salon. It is of great
size, and splendidly fitted up with mirrors, lustres,
and musicians' galleries. The floor is a dark and
delicate parquetrie; the walls are covered by
Riguier in the Louis Quatorze style, with cupids,
flowers, and arabesques. Here the solitary traveller
can lounge in luxury on red velvet, or friends can
cluster their chairs together and converse. For a
short time you may be deluded into the belief that
the word on the wall outside is the true sign of the
entertainment to be found within. But presently
you hear a little chink—chink—chink, and a low
monotonous voice saying something which you
cannot hear, but which seems to be always the same.
You stroll up and down the salon; you pass a door
<!-- Leaf 66, Page: 58 -->
from which a hot gaseous breath pours out upon
you like a flame-blast from a furnace. You catch
a glimpse of dark figures stooping over shaded
lamps. You enter and find yourself in one of the
salles de jeu. You discover that in a corner of this
paradise M. Benazet keeps a hell.


Among the hedge of faces which at all hours
enclose the table of roulette and rouge-et-noir were
those of Lorini and Jenoure. The latter spoke :


\"An atrocious cynic has said that to render
heaven perfect one ought to be able to see the
damned writhing in agony beneath. The idea is
good, though borrowed from the Ship-wreck of
Lucretius. Now I will improve upon it. Imagine
that the people in the first place owed their
happiness to the follies of the people in the second, and
had the pleasure of looking on at them besides.
Such is our position here. We have an agreeable
club where both sexes meet for Conversation; we
have a reading-room with all the newspapers; we
have delicious music three times per diem; we have
capital roads in the neighbourhood if we wish to
ride and drive; and if we want a day's shooting we
only go to Pluto, who will give us permission, get us a
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 59 -->
licence, and lend us guns and ammunition : and all
without spending a single sou ! This club is built,
these musicians are paid, these roads are laid down
with the blood and brains of the idiots whom we
have the additional pleasure of seeing and studying
here. Now, what would man do if he were a
philosopher ? He would calmly enjoy all these
pleasures, and he would come to the tables now and
then to smile at human folly, and write down
reflections in his memorandum-book. But man is
not a phflosopher, because he cannot be content.
I have read the " Times" for nothing. I have
listened to the music for nothing; but I want to
have my dinner for nothing; I put down a louis on
the red, and I—well, I win as it happens. Come, we
will dine at the restaurant next door."


\"Another thing," continued Jenoure, as they sat
down to table; " because I have won a little, I ask a
friend to dinner; I increase my expenses; you
consent to dine with me when" I win, because it is
the Bank's money we spend; but if you were to
sayto me, 'Dine with me to-day because you have
lost!' I should feel insulted. Gambling teaches
many a young man to be extravagant; money which
<!-- Leaf 68, Page: 60 -->
men rake up from green cloth goes as lightly as it
seems to come."


When they were again at the tables, Lorini said :
\"You have come here to study the passions, but
where are they ? I have watched everybody pretty
closely, but beyond a twitch of the lips, or an
upraised eyebrow, or a foot tapped against the
floor, I have discovered nothing. A man did thump
the table just now after he had lost a thaler, but
look at that old gentleman playing with rouleaux,
and at that woman with the pile of gold before her.
Can you see any passion there ?"


\"The suppression of feeling is in itself a fine
study," replied Jenoure, " but I have already
observed more than you would suppose."


When they returned to the hotel, Jenoure made
a rapid sketch.  
  
  
  " Is that a study ? " asked Lorini.  
  
  
  :' Yes," said Jenoure.  
  
  
  " Show it me ?"  
  
  
  " I will some day," he replied.


\"Have you played yet ? " said the Baroness to
Eugenio, one afternoon.  
  
  
  "No," said he; "I mean to be a philosopher."
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 61 -->

\"Well," she said, giving him a note, " go and play
for me, and come back precisely in an hour's time."


Lorini went into the roulette-room, without
understanding the game in the least. He saw an expanse
of green cloth divided into thirty-six little squares,
each of which contained a number, and with a few
larger ones marked, pair, impair, passe, manque,
rouge, noir, &c. He observed that almost everyone
staked upon a number. Having changed his note, he
placed a heap of gold upon the 23. The croupier
pushed back some of the pieces, leaving twelve louis
on the number, and cried maximum! In the
centre of the table was a kind of well, from the
centre of which rose the handle of a brass wheel;
this wheel was turned by a man, who said in a
sepulchral tone, " Messieurs, suites votre jeu." At
the same time he sent a little white ball spinning
round in a circular groove; in a minute or so it fell
from the groove into the bottom of the well, and
dancing about among thirty-six little holes, each of
which contained a colour, and a number
corresponding with those upon the table. At the same time,
the man cried, " Rien ne va plus." The ball settled
into a hole. The croupier cried, " Vingt-trois
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 62 -->
rouge, impair et passe. A little buzz went round
the table, and covetous eyes were fixed on Lorini's
gold. A mass of notes and louis were pushed
towards him. He put them into his pocket with an
air of equanimity, but secretly perplexed. The 23
came up a second time. At this was a roar of
laughter, and exclamations in all the languages of
Europe. A gentleman who stood by Lorini saw
that he was ignorant of the game, and explained
to him that a stake on a number was paid
thirtysix times its amount. He had therefore won 864
louis. "You had better withdraw your mise," he
said, "the 23 is not likely to come up again."
Lorini took his advice, put 500 louis aside, and
played boldly on the colours. He was so successful
that before the end of the hour the superintendent
had rang a bell, and a little boy had brought a bag
of rouleaux to replenish the bank. His last stake
was a maximum 7000 francs on the red, which he
won. He then left the room with a fortune in his
pocket, passed through a whispering crowd
assembled in the grand assembly-room, and returned to
the villa. The Baroness was lying on a sofa; he
covered her with bank notes and louis d'ors.  
  
  
  >
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 63 -->
\"This is Jupiter and Danae revived," said
Jenoure.


The Baroness sprung up, dripping with gold, and
cried, clapping her snowy little hands, " Do this
for yourself, mon cher, and you will not find the
season at Paris severe." Lorini did not answer, but
his eyes flashed. Jenoure subdued a smile.


The next time that they went together to the
tables, Lorini made his friend explain to him the
principles of roulette, and listened patiently to a
dissertation on the different chances of the game,
and on the different theories which had been brought
to bear upon them. The next dajT Jenoure found
him reading a little pale-green book, the cover of
which represented a goddess seated on a large wheel,
while from each hand was showering a stream of
gold, and over whom was written the device—
Gluck gedenke onem.


That same evening as they were promenading
before the Conversation-House, Jenoure having
stopped to speak with an English friend, missed his
companion, and traced him to the roulette-room,
where he found him winning largely on his own
account.
<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 64 -->

Pleasure had begun to pall upon Lorini. Had
he never met with Maddalena, he would doubtless
have always lived on enjoying these dinners without
digestion, these intimacies without friendship*, and
these liaisons without love, which constitute social
life. He would have been contented with the
caresses of the boudoir, and the flatteries of the salon.
He would have married, and in his old age have
intrigued with the world for his children, as in his
youth he had intrigued for himself. But that
twelvemonth of love had spoilt him for society; it had
made fibres vibrate within his heart, which now lay
dormant and unstrung, but which ere they wasted
quite away, at times beat fiercely within him. He
no longer enjoyed the bustle of an elegant crowd
with its brilliant lights, its hum of flirtation, and its
atmosphere of perfumes. He was no longer
satisfied with Olga's embraces; in vain he looked into
her eyes for the soft deep light of love; in vain he
listened in her voice for that tender, tremulous tone
which in another's voice he had known so well; in
vain he hoped to feel in the mad raptures of passion
that electric thrill which a look from Maddalena had
often been sufficient to excite. As men in their
<!-- Leaf 73, Page: 65 -->
middle age sometimes spend a night among the
gaieties of town, and are disgusted with those
pleasures which delighted them in their youth, so
Eugenio returned to his former life, but as a
different man.


When he had heard that Maddalena was married,
he had laughed, and said, " She is like all the others,
then." Another time he had said, " I am glad of it.
She has disenchanted me now; otherwise I might
have regretted her." He deceived the penetration
of Jenoure, who supposed that he was quite cured.
Indeed, he deceived himself But the memory of
Maddalena was always alive within him : it was a
poison in his heart, which sometimes slept, but
which broke out from time to time; which lay torpid
when his mind was engaged, but which tortured
him when he was thoughtful and alone, in his
midday reveries, or in the long and solitary hours of
the night. At last, like those who suffer from a
painful malady, he did not dare to be alone. He
spent his nights with his mistress, his days with the
world. Yet even this could not always save him
from his thoughts. He became silent and abstracted
in the midst of company. The embraces even of  
  
  
  VOL. II. p
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 66 -->
Olga reminded him of his old love; once he called
her Maddalena by mistake; and often closing his
eyes, he would strain her to his breast, and glue his
lips to hers, whispering to himself, " It is Maddalena
that I hold within my arms."


Lorini required an opiate to stifle this eternal
agony. Society was a medicine which, at first
efficacious, had lost its power upon his mind. But he
found another at last. As a traveller who sees a
prairie-fire rolling on him, tears up the grass all
round with shuddering hands, sets it in a blaze
and crouches in safety on the blackened ground,
encompassed by smoke and flames — so Lorini
opposed poison to poison, passion against passion.
He became a gambler, and for the second time
forgot that Maddalena had ever existed in his life.


He passed rapidly through the three first stages
of this fatal mania. First is the stage of timidity:
the gambler plays with caution and without hope;
he knows that the odds are heavily against him;
he wins, and passes into the stage of confidence.
Then he believes that he is endowed with second
sight; that for him the laws of nature are subverted,
and that chance stands still; he plays recklessly, and
<!-- Leaf 75, Page: 67 -->
begins to lose; he passes into the stage of fury;
spits impotently against the Fates, and is only
restored to reason when the whole of his winnings
are sucked back into the Bank.


But Lorini paid as interest to this loan all the
money which he had in the world.  
  
  
  " What will you do now ?" asked Jenoure,


\"I will sell my lands and villa," he replied; " and
when I have broken this cursed bank I will buy them
back."


\"Be content to mortgage them, and live economi
cally for a few years. That is the best way of winning
back your money."


\"It is too slow. Besides, I like playing," he said,
with a bitter laugh. " It amuses me."


Jenoure shrugged his shoulders, reflected for
a few moments, and gave Lorini the address of a
money-lender in the town. Lorini had a little
hesitation in stating his case; but his man met him more
than half-way, knowing very well what his business
was before he came. He had even written to
Florence to make inquiries. At Baden those who
play high are studied. Their gains and losses are
known to everyone, and form the staple subject of  
  
  
  p 2
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 68 -->
conversation. As the money-lender was taking notes
of Lorini's statements, a letter was brought in. He
read it twice, raised his eyebrows, and glancing at
Lorini, said, " It has just occurred to me, Monsieur
le Marquis, that I know of a party who wishes to
buy land round Florence. Have you thought of
any price ? These affairs are usually settled by
valuation; but, as I presume you wish to lose no
time 


\"Exactly," said Lorini; " I wish the affair to be
despatched as soon as possible."


\"Name a price, then, and if it be reasonable my
man will pay it down."


Lorini named a sum which he thought would be
sufficient to pit against the capital of the bank.
He made sure of being able to pay it back; and
reserved the right of repurchase during the next
six months. Thus it cost him no struggle to part
with the family estate; he regarded it as virtually a
mortgage though professedly a sale.


The money-lender thought that there would be
no difficulty in introducing this reservation, and said,
"There is also one stipulation, which my client
wishes to make. He desires (I believe from political
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 69 -->
reasons) that his name should be kept a secret. His
name, therefore, will not be filled up till after you or
your man of business have read the papers over. Do
you agree to this ?"


\"I will agree to anything," said Lorini, with the
sublime indifference of the gambler. Then he added,
\"It will not take long, I hope ? "


"My clerks shall work all night, Monsieur le
Marquis; and to-morrow, at this hour, the money and
the bill of sale shall be ready for you."


Lorini thanked him, and took up his hat to go with
a hesitating air.


"If Monsieur le Marquis wishes a sum in
advance, we can let him have it—at the usual rate of
interest."


Lorini's face brightened up. " Then let me have
a few thousand francs," said he. " Who knows,"
thought he, as he walked off, stuffing the notes into
his pocket, " perhaps I might break the bank to-day,
and not have to sell mj* vineyards after all."


\"I have contrived to do a little business on my
own account," muttered the usurer, and read the
letter over again. " So ! This is the most
extraordinary affair that I have had yet in Baden, where all
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 70 -->
is extraordinary. But there is still the old palace.
Perhaps I may be able to get that for myself."


The next day Lorini presented himself punctually
at the office, signed his name at the foot of a
sheepskin document, and received a bundle of notes in
exchange. He then repaid the sum which he had
borrowed the day before (jplus a heavy interest), and
walked quickly towards the Conversation House.


At Baden you may easily pick out the inveterate
gambler; in a place where all other people saunter,
he strides along, looking straight before him, like a
city man in London walking to his office.


He now passed into the fourth stage. He began
to gamble on a system; he regulated his
irregularities, and methodised his vice. This is the highest
effort of dissipation; it seizes the weapons and
resources of a virtue.


Every morning, escaping from the villa by one of
those tortuous and sheltered alleys with which
Baden is conveniently encircled, he met Jenoure at
Chevet's, where they breakfasted together. At a
quarter before eleven he entered the roulette-room,
and seating himself on a sofa amused himself by
watching the opening of the Bank. Two valets
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 71 -->
with flushed faces and straining arms would bring
in an enormous box, which they placed upon a
chair. The croupiers would take their seats. The
superintendent having opened the box, would seat
himself at the table with paper, pen, and ink.
Piles of notes would be taken out, counted, and
deposited in layers in the bank. Delicate looking
rolls of gold pieces in pink paper would be set
free, and massed together. Huge sausage-rolls of
thalers and double florins would fall clashing on
the table, and ranged in long lines upon the green
cloth. The superintendent having registered
everything, would depart. The croupiers would take up
their rakes; the lid would be taken off the roulette
well, that gulf which has swallowed so many
fortunes, and as eleven struck musically from a Louis
Quatorze clock, the white ball would be sent slowly
round, and in a low, dreamy tone, the "Messieurs,
faites votre jeu," and the "Rien ne va plus," would
be droned forth.


As if summoned by these magical words, and by
the click of the marble in its brass circus,
half-adozen men would draw up to the table, and take
their seats. These were the genuine gamblers—
<!-- Leaf 80, Page: 72 -->
men who spent their existence over gold and green
cloth, and in whose faces those tints appeared to be
reflected. Their complexions were livid; their
features calm and compressed; their eyes
unnaturally bright. They had cards before them, and
punted carefully; they staked high sums, but at
rare intervals. There was one exception,—an old
gentleman,—who played upon the numbers, and
half covered the table with gold pieces every
time.


Lorini played from eleven till three; then rode on
horseback with Jenoure, or sometimes paid the
Baroness a formal visit, till five. At that hour
they dined at the table d'hote in the Cour de
Bade. At seven he returned to the roulette-room,
where a chair was always reserved for him, and
played till midnight, when the tables closed. He
then walked up to the villa, where Olga secretly
admitted him; and where Julie served them with a
recherche' supper. If he had won, he was gay and
sparkling; made Olga describe Paris, and chattered
over the pleasures which they would there enjoy.
If he had lost he was moody and sullen; often
refused to eat or drink, and was not to be cheered
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 73 -->
or softened by one of the most captivating of her
sex.


\"This man is brutalised, Julie," said the
Baroness one day; " but he may yet win a
fortune."


\"I fear not, madam," said the soubrette; " the
Marchese is one of those fools whom Providence

has forgotten to watch over."


\"Well, well, we shall see," said her virtuous
mistress; " it cannot last much longer. There is
some consolation in that."


Thus Lorini gambled nine hours out of every day,
and even when absent from the tables his mind was
always there; even when he slept, numbers danced
before his eyes, and the low droning voice chanted
in his ears its melancholy eternal refrain.
Sometimes he had the nightmare!—an enormous nugget of
gold would pass before him; he would stretch out
his hands to seize it, when it would turn to a mass of
black adamant, and fall with a crushing weight upon
his chest; and then it would become all red and
glare before him, and he would plunge his hands
into it and find it blood; and he would hear
mocking voices which cried, " Rouge gagne ! rouge perd! "
<!-- Leaf 82, Page: 74 -->
and he would wake up bathed in sweat, and his
breast quivering with pain. At such moments the
mere company of a human being was an
inexpressible relief; at such moments he felt afraid, like
children, of being alone; and even Olga, cold-hearted
as she was, sometimes felt a thrill of pity, and almost
of love, for this unhappy man who shuddered at
her side.


There are few who, having commenced this
detestable life, leave it of their own accord. Gambling is
the most ferocious passion of man; those of women
and of wine are comparatively brief, and bring their
own reaction. But gambling has its grandeur; it is
not only an enjoyment, it is a contest. The gambler
fights with a shadow; he calculates against Chance.
He is animated by a hope which never dies: when
he loses he sets his teeth and returns again to this
unequal duel, crying, " Death, or a fortune!" within
his heart. When he wins, when he rakes in the
money, which chinks and clatters and tosses up and
down, with the notes rising like foam-flakes to the
top, he feels the delight of an angler who has landed
a salmon after he has played it for an hour, and
more than his delight, for the salmon is of gold.
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 75 -->
Then, as the play goes on, he passes his hand
through the heap that is before him; he loves better
to caress these shining pieces than a woman's soft
bosom or silky hair. He looks down upon them
with adoring eyes; he reads in their faces a
realisation of all his dreams, while the hum and swaying of
the crowd, the chinking of the money, the voices of
the croupiers, for him surpass the excitements of the
wildest orgie. Thus the gambler's brain is
employed; his energy and courage are awakened; his
imagination is excited; his senses are enraptured;
he tastes all emotions turn by turn; he plays at
SEESAW with a demon; rises almost to heaven, clutches
wildly at the blue sky, and, yelling, descends into the
infernal gulf!


Fortune always fluctuates. More than once Lorini
might have left off a rich man. But a gambler's
ambition expands in proportion to his fortune; it
becomes insatiable, and knows no bounds.


He sat at the table, his last heap of gold before
him. The face of the croupier appeared to him
stern and remorseless as a Fate. Again that long
rake was thrust forth; again, and again, and again.
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 76 -->
It was all gone; he was a ruined man. He pushed
back his chair. What a strange significance has that
dull, scraping sound. But as he rose he felt
something rustle in his pocket. It was a maximum
which he had put aside as a reserve. He placed it
upon the red and won.


It was night. He returned to the hotel, and went
to Jenoure's room. He was not there. He
recollected that the Baroness gave a supper that night, to
which Jenoure had been invited. He sat down for a
few moments, for he was tired, and he had not eaten
for eleven hours. He had won largely in the
beginning of the day, and instead of going, as usual, at
three, he had remained there till nine. A large
portfolio laid upon the table before him; he opened
it listlessly and turned over the drawings which it
contained. Suddenly he saw a portrait of himself,
and another, and another. His face reddened with
rage, and he flung them upon the floor. Then he
picked them up, and looked calmly into this mirror
of his mind—the features of which were passions,
and the expression, vice. The first study represented
him looking with careless curiosity at the play, a
half mocking, half wondering smile upon his lips.
<!-- Leaf 85, Page: 77 -->
In the second he had staked a louis, and was in the
act of drawing away as if sure that he would lose.
In the third he was passing out of the salle-de-jeu,
with a radiant face, counting a mass of gold pieces
which he carried in his hand. In the fourth he was
bending over the board, his eyes fixed on the little
white ball which was dancing in the well. In the
fifth he was watching a pile of notes being raked
in by the croupier, whose stolid face contrasted
admirably with his own. In the last he was looking
into the Oo's. This sketch horrified him so that he
almost swooned away. He remembered that night
well : he had lost almost all that he had; he was
walking with Jenoure; and as they passed over the
bridge he recalled with a shudder the thought which
had passed through his mind. He little guessed
that it had been so faithfully reflected on his face.
\"0 God ! " he cried. " My God ! have mercy on me.
What am I to do ?"


He thrust the drawings in his breast, and went
out. He climbed the hill which overlooked the
town. Below him lay the accursed House blazing
with light, and the crowd which passed undulating
to and fro. His heart sickened at the sight. He
<!-- Leaf 86, Page: 78 -->
climbed on till he had screened it from him by a
wall of foliage. Now he was alone. Looking 'round
him, he saw no traces of man. Listening, he heard
no sounds save the vague mysterious murmurs of
the night. Kneeling down, he clasped together his
moist cold hands, and cried, " 0 God ! My God ! have
mercy on me ! What am I to do ?"


He had floated on a blue and buoyant sea, with
his eyes towards the sun; but the night had come;
the waters ebbed from him, and left him naked on
the sand. He had wasted his life; he had forfeited his
birthright; he had lost his love. "0 God!" he cried.
\"My God ! have mercy on me. What am I to do ?"  
  
  
  Then there rose from beneath him the voices of

sweet instruments. It was the Requiem of Mozart,
which the Kursaal band, concealed from his sight,
began to play. This music, which arose from an
unseen source, appeared to him an answer to his
prayer; it assuaged his bitter grief; it soothed him
like a tender woman's words. He sat as if
entranced; his heart swelling, and the tears falling
from his eyes. And then, as he listened, ideas began
to rise from the recesses of his mind, and passed to
and fro, like shadows, unshaped and dim. The
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 79 -->
creative faculty, long chained by sloth and vice,
arose and rent its bonds. He was bewildered; he
felt, he suffered, he desired—he knew not what.
Then a grand thought burst within him into life.
He sprang to his feet, his frame quivered with
emotion, his brain was in a blaze.


\"Divine Mozart !" he cried, stretching out his
arms towards the stars, " I become thy disciple ! I
will labour at thy feet! I will rival thee, or die!"


His arms fell to his side; but his eyes remained
fixed on the sky. He stood thus till more than two
hours had passed. A clock struck twelve. He
started, and said :—


\"Now to finish with this life, and to-morrow to
begin anew."


He descended the hill, singing to himself the
melodies which his thoughts had formed. He went to
his room, unlocked a desk, made up a bundle of
letters in a woman's hand, and again passed out into
the street;


At Baden an astonishing freedom of manners and
morals prevails. Can vice really impregnate the
air ? Can physical contact with fair sinners at the
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 80 -->
table d'hote, the Kursaal, and the promenade, lay
the seeds of serious incontinence, and communicate
moral leprosy ? Let psychology discuss this question.
It is certain that at Baden ladies do not imitate

the demi-mondes only in their toilettes. At Baden
society suspends her criminal laws. Even scandal is
silent, since she can do no one any harm; only those
are talked of who behave themselves with caution
and propriety. Quancl tout le monde est bossu la
belle taille devient une monstruosite'.


At Baden our Baroness became a perfect little rake.
Her life was a whirl of gaiety, a continual waltz.
There were breakfasts at the old Schloss to the
music of Eolian harps; picturesque pic-nics in the
neighbourhood; alfresco dinners, and delicious
tetesa-tetes in those boudoirs which Nature had furnished
with her own hands; balls at the Kursaal twice a
week; and sometimes little suppers at her own
villa, to which only a convivial coterie was invited,
and at which only confidential domestics served. It
was to one of these suppers that we now transfer the
scene. The party consisted of ten, the sexes being
equal. They were seated at a round table. The
smoking meats and the delicate entremets had been
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 81 -->
borne away. Champagne and cigarettes alone
remained upon the board. The servants had retired.


At Olga's right hand sat the Vicomte de
Beaumont, who had been so intimate with her at Florence.
He had not been able for her sake to brave the
inclemency of a London season, but had met her at
Baden like Lorini, and perhaps half-a-dozen others,
by the purest accident. He held a high place in her
esteem, for he was the rage just then. He drove the
best horses, had rented the best villa, and gave the
best dinners there. He had also broken the bank,
exposed a card swindler of high rank, and shot a
husband in a duel on the frontier,—achievements
of which he was justly proud.


At her left hand sat Jenoure, who was as well
known in the Parisian as in the London world. The
rest of the party it will be needless to describe.
Three of the ladies were young and handsome; the
other was middle-aged, but had written comedies,
and was celebrated for her wit. The men were all
noted for one thing or another, and the whole decade
were of easy morals, but of high rank. The Baroness
abhorred the middle classes.  
  
  
  " Where is the Marchese dei Lorini 1" asked the  
  
  
  vol. ir. g
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 82 -->
authoress, with an air of naivete- which made
everybody smile !


The Baroness shrugged her pretty shoulders.
\"Oh, playing, as usual, 1 suppose."


"I have seen a great many men play," said
Alphonse de Beaumont, "but I never saw any one
play so badly as Lorini. He seems to have no
selfcommand. You can always tell whether he is
winning or losing, by his face. Then his system is
altogether wrong. When he wins, he is extremely
cautious; when he loses, he becomes enraged, and
heaps on money with both hands. Now, when I
broke the bank, I did exactly the reverse. Fortune
does not alternate—she runs in series."


\"She alternates one day; she runs in series the
next," said Jenoure.


\"If losing, play low," said the Vicomte; " if
winning, play high."


\"I think, on the contrary," said Jenoure, " that if
one has lost several times, one should stake high to
win back all at a single coup."  
  
  
  "What game does Lorini play?" asked some

one.  
  
  
  " Always roulette," replied Jenoure. " I earnestly
<!-- Leaf 91, Page: 83 -->
advised him, if he would play, to take
trente-etquarante, which is a much better game."


\"Certainly," said De Beaumont. "When I broke
the bank it was at trente-et-quarante. Whoever
broke a bank at roulette, I should like to know ?"


\"If anyone could do it, Vicomte, you would be
the man," said Jenoure; " but the administration does
not allow it. They keep up the supply at roulette,
and pile bank upon bank."


\"They say it is a good game," said one of the
guests, " to put two louis on the douze-premier, and
three on the passe. Thus you have only six figures
against you."


\"Pardon me," said Jenoure; " with the two zeros
you have eight. You can only win one louis, and
you can lose five. Lorini thought that he had found
a mare's nest with that game, but gave it up after
he had lost twenty-thousand francs."


\"The best way, I think," said another, " is to put
a louis on a colour and leave it to accumulate. If
you happen to hit a series, you may win a colossal
sum"


"Yes," said Jenoure; "but you may lose a colossal
sum before you hit your series."  
  
  
  o 2
<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 84 -->

\"I don't believe in any of these theories," said the
third gentleman. " After all, it must be pure chance."


\"No," said Jenoure, " one can scarcely say that it
is pure chance. As the births of male and female
children bear always the same proportion to each
other in a huge population, and during a long period
of time, so the red and black have been found to be
equally balanced at the end of the year. The
revolutions of numbers and cards perplex us, as those of
the heavenly bodies perplex people who are
unacquainted with astronomy. Yet we see that their
results are regulated; it is for some future Galileo
to discover their laws."  
  
  
  " Does any one believe in dreams ? " asked a lady.  
  
  
  The negative was general.


\"Well," said Jenoure. " You may believe me or
not as you please; but when I was a very young
man I used to have inspirations. I played by system,
but sometimes a number or a colour would catch my
eye. I would feel an irresistible inclination to stake
upon it. I would do so, feeling as sure that I should
win, as I do that I am going to drink this glass of
champagne"—(the Baroness drank it, and there was
a laugh),—" and without being disappointed."
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 85 -->
i " That is a valuable talent; can you command it
when you please ?"


"No; if I waited for the fairy she would not come,
and she deserted me long ago."


\"When I broke the bank, I'll tell you what I did,"
said De Beaumont: "I took a pack of cards. When
the croupiers shuffled theirs, I shuffled mine; when
they offered theirs to the players to cut, I offered
mine to the croupiers to cut. I dealt mine before
they dealt theirs, and the results were almost always
the same."


\"That was the first time you made the experiment,
Vicomte ?" asked Jenoure.  
  
  
  " Yes."


\"Well, next time you will probably find that the
two results will be almost always different."


\"It is possible," said the Vicomte; " but there
will be no next time for me. I have broken a bank
—it is a thing which one ought to do, but I shall
never play again."


\"You are right! " said the Baroness. " Nothing
appears to me so degraded as a mind swallowed up
in the passion for play."  
  
  
  " Poor Lorini," thought Jenoure; " it is clear that
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 86 -->
you are dethroned." Then he continued: "You
have heard, I suppose, what the head-croupier said
about you."  
  
  
  "I have not had that pleasure."


"They were laughing at him because you had
broken the bank. ' Pooh !' said he, ' there is nothing
we like better when our man is rich. Monsieur
le Vicomte, I hear, has made a resolution never
to "play again. Rubbish! They all do that. But
he will never forget that he has won; he may
travel round the world; he may inter himself
in the country with a young and virtuous wife; he
may become politician, agriculturist, or philosopher;
but he will be sure to come back here and lose what
he has won, with a great deal more besides."  
  
  
  "We shall see," he replied.


\"There is certainly nothing more difficult," said a
guest, " than to look on the tables without playing,
if one has once begun. It is like looking down into
an abyss without having the vertigo. Jenoure here
can do it; who else could ?"


\"I do it to discipline my mind," said Jenoure. " I
regard it professionally, as I do a beautiful woman
whom I am painting. My brain extinguishes my
<!-- Leaf 95, Page: 87 -->
passions. But it is difficult, especially after one has
broken three banks, Monsieur le Vicomte."j


De Beaumont talked no more about his bank,
much to everyone's relief. An old gentleman said :


\"The passion for play is something by itself. You
would suppose now that the croupiers at least would
be free from this almighty folly. But no; I am
told that after midnight they frequently play among
themselves, banking turn by turn."


\"Many of the croupiers are ruined gamblers," said
Jenoure. " But, apropos of those gentry, did you ever
hear the story of the croupier's daughter ? Well,
then, it is this. Wiesbaden and Homburg, as you all
know, are the hells par excellence. Here gambling
is a distraction, there a pursuit; and at these places
the administration is very sedulous in attracting and
retaining visitors. The reading-room, the restaurants
and at Homburg billiard-rooms also, are all beneath
the same roof. A hundred petty stratagems are
employed : for instance, cheap lodgings are provided
for those ladies whose interest it is to retain the rich,
and to make them play. Well, some years ago,
either at Homburg or Wiesbaden, a man broke the
bank. He determined (like you, Vicomte) not to
<!-- Leaf 96, Page: 88 -->
play again, made pastoral incursions in the
neighbourhood, and announced his intention of returning
home. Now, one of the croupiers had a very
beautiful daughter. She was promised twenty-thousand
francs if she could recover the sum that had been
lost. She contrived to captivate him; they eloped
together, and made a romantic, but economical, tour
in Switzerland. Presently she began to dream. She
saw her lover playing, and staking maximums every
time, and then going from the table, his hands' filled
with gold. As she woke him up regularly three
times every night to tell him this, he began to
believe that it must be a genuine revelation, and
returned to lose everything—including the croupier's
daughter. The administration paid his fare home,
and he has not been heard of since."


\"Oh ! enough of these horrid tables !" cried the
Baroness. "I do not know how it is—at Baden one
talks of nothing else."


\"The queen has spoken, and the topic shall be
changed," said Jenoure. "Now what is to be done?"


\"Dance one of those charming cotillons," said the
authoress. " I shall be most happy to play for
you."
<!-- Leaf 97, Page: 89 -->

\"Yes, yes ! " they all cried, starting up. " The
champagne cotillon ! the champagne cotillon ! "


Olga glided over to the authoress, and arched her
beautiful neck to whisper in her ear, " Is it not too
soon ?"


Her experienced friend glanced at the flushed
faces and gleaming eyes of the guests. " It is the
moment! " she said. " Come, let us begin."


Eight chairs were set arranged in a circle, and
the cotillon began. At first they danced in the
ordinary manner; but the figures (which had been
invented by the Vicomte and the Sackowsky)
became gradually more and more bizarre; finally
it broke into a graceful romp, and when they
returned to their seats the space in the centre
resembled a battle-field, being covered with the
shreds of dresses. In the second part of the dance,
at a certain period, two bottles of champagne were
opened by De Beaumont and Jenoure, all glasses
were filled and clinked together; and at the same
time a toast was to be given.


\"To all husbands who are enamoured of their
wives !" cried the Vicomte. There was a laugh;
the glasses were emptied, and they waltzed madly
<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 90 -->
round and round. The little Sashinka, also with a
champagne-glass in her hand, skipped about by
herself in a state of infantine frenzy, in a corner
of the room, and sometimes dancing in among them,
executed a pas seul in imitation of some premiere
danseuse whom she had seen at the opera. " Elle a
la poisie dans lesjambes, cet enfant!" said her fond
mother, with an approving smile.


Again the corks popped; again foiu* white arms,
flecked with champagne froth, were held out; again
eight pair of eyes exchanged looks of liquid fire,
and Jenoure, raising his glass, exclaimed, " To
all wives who are not enamoured of their
husbands."


The laugh ascended to a shriek of delight, and
in the waltz which followed Olga's hair became
unloosed, and fell down to her waist in long golden
waves.


She raised it with her little hands, but a lady
-cried,—


\"Oh, leave it, dear, you look as lovely as a
Venus."


\"And as dissipated as a Bacchante," said
Jenoure.
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 91 -->

\"Sing Tl segreto per esser felice," said the
Vicomte, dipping his hands in her hair.


She gave him a look, and held out her glass, which
he filled. They seated themselves. She stood
before them and raised her glass in the air, and sang
while the other played—  
  
  
  " 11 segreto per esser felice,  
  
  
  So per prova, e l'insegno agli amici;
Sia sereno, sia nubilo, il cielo.
Ogni tempo, sia caldo, sia gelo,
Scherzo e bevo, derido gl' insani,
Che si dan del futuro pensier;
Non curiamo l'incerto domani,
Se quest' oggi n'e dato goder !"


\"Wise and charming sentiments," cried De
Beaumont, who had drunk too much wine. " Who cares
for the morrow when the night is pleasant. Not I
for one. To-morrow is an illusion, to-night is sweet
reality. Wreathe the garland, fill the wine-cup, and
let some fair woman kiss me on the lips."  
  
  
  " Come ! the next verse, Baroness ! " they cried.


Jenoure, who had been listening, sprang up and
cried, "I hear a sword rattle. There is a chorus
behind the scenes ! " As he spoke the folding-doors
were flung open with a crash. A tall man in a grey
great-coat, with the cross of St. George upon his
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 92 -->
breast, strode into the room. His forehead was
furrowed by an immense scar; his face was
inexpressibly sinister and stern.


He stood still with his arms folded on his breast.
The Baroness gave a frightened whisper, and her
guests hurried out.


As soon as they were gone, she flung herself upon
him, and wound her arms round his neck. " Dearest
Konstantine," she cried, " how thou hast alarmed me I
After five years of absence—"


\"To find you thus, madam," said the General,
touching her hair, and looking round at the ddbris
of the orgie.


\"It came down when I was dancing, and I was
just going to ring for my maid when you came in.
The tiresome hair, I wish it was all cut off. Why
didst thou not write ? Didst thou wish to surprise
me, wicked man ? But know that when one loves,
these surprises sometimes kill."


\"Mamma ! " cried the little Sashinka, " who is
that man ?"


She was standing in a corner of the room with
a champagne-glass still in her hand, the wine
dripping from it on the floor*.
<!-- Leaf 101, Page: 93 -->

\"That is your dear papa. Come and kiss him,
my child. Is she not lovely, Konstantine ? "


\"Oh, no, that is not my papa; that horrid man,"
said the little girl, recoiling. Then she assumed
a look of defiance. " I have a much prettier papa
than you."


The Baroness gave a forced laugh. " She always
calls her Italian master papa. Eugenio is your
other papa, is he not, my dear ? "  
  
  
  Sashinka gave her mother a malicious look.


\"No," she said; " Eugenio used to be, but
Alphonse is my papa now. And I like him very much,
because he is so kind to mamma, and talks to her
in such a sweet, soft voice, and writes her letters—
oh, so many—so many—so many—and on the seal
is a little naked boy with a bow and arrow, and his
finger on his lips. What does that mean, you cross
big man ? And what is that nasty mark you've got
on your forehead ? I don't like you at all, I don't."  
  
  
  Her mother nervously rang the bell.


\"She would make a study for Garvami; would
she not, madam ?" said the general, with a sneer.  
  
  
  Julie came in.  
  
  
  " Take the child to-bed," said the Baroness.
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 94 -->
  
  Julie carried her out, straggling.


The general took off his great-coat and sat down.
His wife crept up to him, and curled her warm
white arms round him, and caressed his grey
moustache, and'kissed him on the scar. She hung
over him, and looked fondly into his eyes. Then
she called him Kostya, and whispered something in
his ear.


\"Not yet," he said. " I am hungry; I want some
supper."


\"Come," she said, tapping him on the shoulder;
\"you shall have it up-stairs."


\"Why up-stairs ? This appears to be your
supper-room. Let me have it here."  
  
  
  " But here everything is in such disorder.


\"Bah ! one does not mind that just after a
campaign. Open me a bottle of wine."  
  
  
  " A bottle of wine !"


\"Yes; it will not be the first to-night, judging by
appearances."


She opened a bottle and filled two glasses. " You
will let me drink a welcome to you ? " she said.


\"Certainly, my dear," said the general, with grim
gaiety; " and when that bottle is finished we will
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 95 -->
have another." The Baroness shuddered, and
glanced at the clock.


He took a cigar-case from his pocket. " I need
not ask you," he said, " if you object to this. The
atmosphere reminds me of a barrack-room."


He began to smoke slowly, sometimes sipping his
champagne. Olga paced hurriedly to and fro.


\"What is the matter ?" he said. " You seem to
be very restless."


\"Oh, Konstantine," she said, coming to him;
\"this room makes me ashamed of the people I have
entertained to-night. But thou canst hardly imagine
what a life one is forced to lead in this horrible
place."


Then she passed her velvet hand across his face
with a feline gesture. " Come, dearest—to oblige
me. Do not let us stay here any longer."


The general stole a look at the clock. "Well,"
said he, "when I have finished my cigar, I will
gratify your whim. And now sit down. Why do
you keep moving about like that ?"


\"Let me go out for a moment to order a nice
supper for you."  
  
  
  " Order my supper! Pooh ! When we go
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 96 -->
upstairs they can send me a chicken bone or
two."


\"And I want to see if the child has been put to
bed. Let me go, dearest, do."


\"It is now nearly half-past twelve. What does
it matter if the child be in bed a few minutes

sooner or later ? "


\"Yes—yes, it is nearly half-past twelve," said the
Baroness, turning very pale. Then with a mad
laugh, she sprang to the door. " I wont be
tyrannised over," she said, with a little mutinous
shake of her head. She seized the handle of the
door.


He gave a stride, passed his arm round her
waist, and lifted her on to his knees. " Patience ! "
he said. " I have told you that we will go when
I have finished my cigar."


She sat there, trembling, and looking from time
to time at his cigar. The clock struck half-past
twelve. She started and glanced at his face.
When she saw his eyes she gave a shriek and ran
to the door. He sprang before it. She flew across
the room towards the window, her hair drifting
behind, her arms outstretched. As she placed her
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 97 -->
hand upon the bolt, three knocks sounded on the
glass from outside.


Sackowsky grasped her shoulder, which became
red under his hand. " I forbid you to speak a word,
madam. Open it at once."


She pushed back the bolt with a hand mottled
by fear. The shutters swung back, and Lorini
stepped into the room.  
  
  
  " I come, madam," he said, " for the last

time
\"You are right, sir," said a deep voice. " It is for
the last time."


Lorini turned and saw a man standing behind him,
dressed in a general's uniform, with one hand resting
on the pommel of his sword. His manner instantly
changed. He made a low bow, and said, with a
polite smile,  
  
  
  " The Baron Sackowsky ? "  
  
  
  The general bowed.


\"I need scarcely say, Baron, that I am at your
service."


\"Will you then be so kind as to take a seat for a
few moments ? Let me offer you a chair. I will
not detain you long." Then he turned to his wife  
  
  
  VOL. I'.  
  
  
  U
<!-- Leaf 106, Page: 98 -->
and said, offering her his arm, " Now, madam, I have
finished my cigar."


They went up to her chamber. Julie was there.
The Baron told her to leave the room, and to return
when he rang. As she passed out, he whispered
somthing to her in French. His wife had fallen on
a fauteuil in a corner of the room.


\"Olga Sackowsky," he said, " I confided to you the
two things which I hold dearest in the world—my
own honour and the innocence of my child."


\"Oh, Konstantine, you believe that I am guilty,"
she said, flinging herself at his feet; " but "  
  
  
  He shrugged his shoulders.


\"Do not take the trouble to lie any more," he
said. " Ivan has watched you, and I know all."


\"Ah," she said, rising, " you have employed a spy
then ?"  
  
  
  " It is the best means of detecting traitors."
\"Sir," replied the Baroness, haughtily, " I shall

waste no more words upon you. You have for ever
forfeited my esteem. You have paid a hireling to
say whatever you please. That is enough for me.
You have your fortune, I have mine; and you may
take the child, since you are so anxious about its
<!-- Leaf 107, Page: 99 -->
innocence. We must separate, and at once, if you
please."


\"But it does not please me that you should
dishonour my name in every capital in Europe. No,
madam, we have been separated too long. In half
an hour you will go back with me to Russia."  
  
  
  " I refuse to go."  
  
  
  The Baron smiled and looked at her.


"You will be made to go, madam, if I have to
gag you, and bind you hand and foot."  
  
  
  " Tartare!" she cried, clenching her fists with

rage.  
  
  
  The Baron made her a low bow.  
  
  
  " Je suis Russe, madame, et vous m'avez gratte\"


Having rung the bell, he left the room. Julie
came in. She had a dark dress hanging on her
arm. Olga ran to her and kissed her on both
cheeks.


\"My dearest Julie," she murmured, in a caressing
voice, " thou art my only hope. Help me to escape
from this monster, and I will make thee rich. Two
women can do anything."


\"Possibly, madam; but in this instance there is
only one."  
  
  
  a 2
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 100 -->

\"What! wilt thou not aid me, Julie ? I will give
thee five thousand francs."  
  
  
  Julie tossed her head.  
  
  
  " Then name your own price."


\"Madam, I have always made it a rule in life to'
go to the highest bidder. The Baron is richer than
you are, and I have no desire to leave his

service.  
  
  
  " You in his service !" she cried.


\"Yes, madam; and I have been for the last three
months."  
  
  
  The Baroness saw that she was lost.


\"Then you are another of his spies," she said,.
bitterly.


\"It was you, madam, who gave me a taste for the
profession, and by practising on the poor little
Restoni I acquired sufficient skill to deceive even
you. But time presses. I have promised my master
to have you ready in half an hour. Be kind enough
to let me put on this dress."


\"That dress !" she cried, looking at it with horror.
"Never! never!"


\"This is nonsense," said Julie, sternly. " Undress
yourself at once. I have no time to lose."
<!-- Leaf 109, Page: 101 -->

\"How dare you address me in that tone,
impertinent wretch ! I will tell my husband. I will "


\"Oh, oh," laughed Julie, " that will only further
me in his good graces."


Then she seized the wrist of her late mistress, and
looked imperiously in her face.


\"Baroness," she said, " let us understand each
other once for all. My master has placed you under
my charge. You are my prisoner, and as long as I
obey his orders I can treat you as I please. Five
thousand francs, indeed! A fortune could not
tempt me to forego the pleasure which I shall have
from you. I have not forgotten all the names which
you have' called me when you were in a bad
temper, as if I was a Russian serf. I am your
mistress now, and my hand is no light one, you will
find. Off with that dress at once, or I will tear it
from your back."


The Baroness unfastened her dress with trembling
hands.  
  
  
  " But Julie," she said, " my jewels—my dresses—'


\"The Baron's servants will pack them up and
follow us to St. Petersburg to-morrow. But I do
not think that you will wear jewels or fine dresses
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 102 -->
any more. No, nor long hair either. My master
said that you wished yours to be cut off, and that I
might have it for a chignon."


The poor woman flung herself sobbing on the bed.
When she felt the cold scissors pass snapping through
her hair she fainted away.


\"You think, sir," said the Baron, " that I am
about to challenge you to a duel a la mort. I have
several reasons, however, for not doing so. In the
first place, although I am the best swordsman and
one of the best pistol-shots in Europe, you might kill
me. The odds are a thousand to one against it; but
upon that one chance rests my wife's last hope. This
risk, slight as it is, I shall not incur. I wish to
preserve my life, for I have a vengeance to inflict. In the
second place, it would be unjust and incomplete that
I should kill you, when you have done me no more
harm than the Vicomte de Beaumont, and Heaven
knows how many men besides. Sdence, sir ! I will
soon convince you that I do not speak without good
grounds for all I say. Thirdly, it is not you who
have done me this great wrong. Had you known me,
had you pretended to be my friend, had you taken
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 103 -->
advantage of my confidence in you to do what you
have done, you would have been a scoundrel, and I
should have killed you like a dog. As it is, you
have committed a folly, not a crime. You met a
woman who, breaking the most sacred oaths, gave
herself up to you. You amused yourself with her as
you would have done with a courtezan, as she really
is. You broke no oath, you betrayed no faith. The
hour of reckoning comes, and you are ready, with a
smile, to sacrifice your life for this miserable love.
Oh, I know that the Lorini are brave. Your father
was my friend, sir. The laws of what men call
honour demand that I should fight with you; but
my honour is dead. It cannot be revived by
blood."


He averted his face for a moment from Lorini,
who saw him shake like an oak in a strong winter
wind. When he turned his face again it was calm,
majestic, and stern.


\"But it is right, sir, that you should be punished
—punished, indeed, you have already been. I will
show you how. Ivan," he cried.  
  
  
  " Oh, sir, before the servant," exclaimed Lorini;

\"you must kill me first."
<!-- Leaf 112, Page: 104 -->

\"Do not be alarmed, Marchese," said the General;
"this man knows everything, and he never talks.
Besides, he will not be present at our conversation."


Ivan brought in a ledger, and, at a word in
Russian from his master, left the room.


"That man is my spy. He has written down
here all that his mistress has done, and almost all
that she has said. Look through these pages,
and learn that when a woman betrays her husband,
she does not remain faithful to her lover. Read
it, sir."


Lorini, half stupefied, half magnetized by a
superior will, opened the book and glanced through its
contents, which were in French. Sometimes he
blushed to the temples; but presently he uttered an
exclamation, and turned pale.


"You have found it, then?" said Sackowsky, with a
slight sneer. " You see that this liaison has cost
you your love, your happiness, your fortune. The
girl Julie is now in my pay; she has given me the
letters which were intercepted. You can take them,
if you please."


Lorini read through those details which have been
already told: of the plot to separate him from
<!-- Leaf 113, Page: 105 -->
Maddalena, and in what manner it had been carried
out. He took the letters and gave back the book.


\"Have you any letters from her ?" said the Baron
in a low voice.


\"They are here, sir," said he, handing him the
bundle of letters he had taken from his desk.  
  
  
  There was an interval of silence.


Then Lorini rose, and said, " Baron Sackowsky, we
have fought a duel, and you have killed my pride,
which is far more precious to me than my life.
I do not know what to say. I am a ruined,
humiliated man. But some day, sir, I may win back my
self-esteem; some day I may become a celebrated
man. I will then come to you and ask you to
forgive me the wrong which I have done your
name."

{empty}. " It is well, sir," said the general, also rising.
\"Those are foolish and not criminal who can feel
shame; and those who are truly noble can afford to
bend. Go, sir, you are young, you may retrieve all.
Avoid vice; preserve the honour of your great
house; labour to add a jewel to its crown of fame;
and in your moments of misery, for misery you will
surely know, console yourself with the thought that
<!-- Leaf 114, Page: 106 -->
there is one who now suffers more than it is possible
for other men to understand."


Lorini bowed humbly, passed through the window
and by a wooden piazza into the garden. He
wandered into the Alley of Lichtenthal. He walked on
and on as in a dream. As sometimes pain is so
acute that the sufferer cannot shriek; as
sometimes grief is so intense that the mourner cannot
weep; so the shock to his mind had been so great
that he could not think; his brain lay crushed and
flattened beneath an indefinable sensation of shame
iind woe.


He was restored to consciousness by a loud,
sonorous, ringing sound. He looked down the avenue
towards the town; a carriage approached, drawn by
four horses at a gallop, and swinging from side to side.
As it passed him a white face flashed at the window.
\"Save me!" cried a well-known voice. At the
same time an enormous hand protruded from the
window and covered the gurgling mouth. Lorini
looked back. A man and woman were seated in the
rumble, and he recognised the horrible laughter of
Julie.  
  
  
  Then a sudden trembling seized him; he felt
<!-- Leaf 115, Page: 107 -->
afraid of the dark; he ran back to the town, and
entered Jenoure's chamber, the cold sweat running
down his face.


Jenoure was lying on the bed dressed, and smiling
over the last chapters of " Gerfaut."  
  
  
  "Well," said he, "what are to be the weapons ?"


Lorini poured out half a tumbler of brandy and
emptied it at a draught.


"You are taking it too soon," said Jenoure, "if
you require that sort of thing. First affair, I
presume ?"


Lorini related all that had taken place. He
wished to disburden his mind by words; and also he
felt a bitter pleasure in confessing his own
humiliation; his mind was still so proud that it could
trample upon itself.


\"God ! what a character!" cried Jenoure. " And
they are gone, then ?"


\"Yes," said Lorini, shuddering. " Oh ! that hand !
Something terrible must be in store for that
unhappy woman."


\"The vengeance of such a man must be artistic,
sublime !" cried Jenoure, walking up and down the
room.
<!-- Leaf 116, Page: 108 -->
  
  " Vengeance on a woman !" exclaimed Lorini.


\"And why not ? Here is this woman, heartless,
shameless, cold as ice, hard as a stone, perjured and
brazen, eaten up with vice, and who amuses herself
by plotting against an innocent girl, and an
inoffensive fool, as coolly as she would sit down to a game
of chess. Well, her sins at length provoke their
punishment; the avenger comes; and then,
forsooth, she has only to weep a few tears, and to
make herself look pale, and every one shall
sympathise with her because she is so beautiful and
so weak. Weak! Such women are stronger than
most of us men. Such tears come from the head,
not from the heart; they are distilled thoughts; and
are composed of rage and hatred, cunning and
deceit."


\"But, Jenoure, the fault is not all on her side. If
a man marries and then leaves his wife all to
herself "


\"She is doubly guilty if she dishonours him.
There is some excuse for a woman who 1$,, watched
day and night, and whose husband is perhaps jealous
of her without cause. But here is a man who is
forced to leave his wife that he may risk his life in
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 109 -->
the service of his country. He says to himself, ' I
will not shut her up in my chateau in the country
and make my relations sheep-dogs over her. I will
not deprive her of harmless gaieties, and condemn
her to a dreary solitude, as I have the right. No, I
will trust her,'—and I say that only the worst women
betray such a trust. Let me tell you, sir, that in our
country, the wives of men who are absent in naval
service or in India, or elsewhere, are the most
virtuous of women. Let me tell you "


\"Oh, Jenoure, Jenoure !" cried Lorini, bursting
into tears, "why did you prevent me from writing
that letter ? I might have been so happy with her."


Jenoure looked at him, and his face softened down.
His lips quivered a little, and he took Lorini's hand.


Eugenio hid his head upon Jenoure's breast. "And
now," he said, " I am a ruined man. I am trod upon
by him; I am laughed at by you; I am loathed by
myself."


\"My poor boy," said Jenoure, in a voice so soft
and sweej; that Lorini looked up in his face, as if
expecting to find that it was some one else,—" believe
me, you are mistaken. You had not quenched your
thirst for the vanities, which now I hope that you
<!-- Leaf 118, Page: 110 -->
have done with for ever. You had not seen enough
of life before. If you had married Maddalena then,
you would have committed some such follies as you
have just done here, and that with a wife would
have been more than folly, you know."


Eugenio did not answer. Jenoure lifted up his
head and kissed him on both cheeks. "Eugenio,"
said he, " what did you say just now ? That you
intended to become an artist, did you not ? "  
  
  
  Eugenio bent his head.


\"Then be thankful that you have no woman to
clog your mind. Women are tyrannical and vain;
they desire to absorb all into themselves; they
become jealous of your time, of your thoughts, of
all that you do not give to them. If you wish to
be great, you must abandon them altogether, or
make them toys; treat them as people of fashion
do their children—have them in only at dessert.
Take them up as books, to recreate the mind through
the senses; read them for ideas, and then fling them
away. The love which women can inspire is a poor
pitiful passion,—insipid, without variety, and
brieffit only, in such men as us, for the first years of
our youth; it is useful then to elevate the mind,
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 111 -->
and to train one to live outside oneself. But that
age for you is passed. Your illusions have
evaporated, have they not^? They do not last long. The
ancients were right in painting Cupid as a child. But
take Art as your mistress, and in the peace and
silence of your study you will taste an enjoyment
intoxicating and sweet as an amour. Take Art as
your mistress, and labour in her arms. You will
have the transports of the father who creates, and
of the woman who conceives; your works will be
your children, and you will love them as no mother
ever loved her child. You will love them as we
love those to whom we devote all our energies, for
whom we sacrifice our fives. Take Art as your
mistress; you will discover new beauties in her
every day; her kisses will never tire you, for each
kiss is a new pleasure, each kiss is an idea. And
this mistress will never betray you; she will remain
true to you always, if you remain true to her. But
you must not flirt with other passions or she will fly.
You must work always. Constant labour is the law
of Art as of life. Voltaire lived in his study, Canova
in his studio. By this steep and stony road alone
can we climb the Apennines of Fame."
<!-- Leaf 120, Page: 112 -->
  
  " You speak from experience, Jenoure I


\"I do. I have learnt life thoroughly, I have
known all pleasures, and almost all pains. I do not
tell you that Fame will make you happy. It is a
flower on a mountain top which withers as soon as it
is grasped. I tell you that there is only one kind of
happiness worth having—that is, hope; and there is
only one kind of hope worth having, and that is hope
put into action—toil."  
  
  
  " Then I will toil."


Jenoure sat down; the excitement was past; his
features re-assumed their habitual cynical expression;
and his voice, when he spoke again, had its old
sarcastic tone.


\"By-the-by," he said, " you have taken my
sketches of you, have you not ? "


\"Here they are," said Lorini, " you are welcome
to use them as you please. But make copies, and let
me have them. They will serve as warnings to me."


\"In that case, you may keep them; the originals
are locked up safely."  
  
  
  " You left them then for meto
"Question me not. The ways of artists are
inscrutable."
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 113 -->

He rang the bell. " I must have my man to pack
up my things," he said.  
  
  
  " Where are you going ?"


\"To a distant country. I have a study to make.
If you wish to hear from me, write to the 'Travellers'.'
Your letters will be forwarded. And now the last
piece of advice I shall give you is to go to-bed."


He opened a portmanteau, humming "II segreto
per esser felice."


\"Ah, Jenoure," said Lorini, as he took his hand,
\"how I envy you. You seem to have gained the
secret of being happy."


\"You think so !" he replied, with a laugh, and
turning suddenly away.


But Lorini saw his face reflected in the mirror.
Was that Jenoure ? A face with agonised eyes and
writhing features, on every lineament of which was
stamped, Despair.  
  
  
  VOL II.

<!-- Leaf 122 -->
  
  (CHAPTER III


It was winter at Vachell Court. The dull dark
sky descended almost to the earth; the fields lay
with their brown entrails upturned, deserted of
labourers, desolate and bare; the trees stood
shivering in the wind, and dropping their yellow leaves.
The earth seemed dead. No sun shone; no birds
sang; even the rooks had left their homes to seek
a shelter in the great beech woods.


At night the wind howled, and an owl flew round
the house, hissing, hooting, and flapping its wide
grey wings.


Then came an iron frost and turned the ground
to stone. The birds sat stupefied on the bushes
round the house, with their feathers puffed out,
and slowly starved to death. The sky was clear,
but cold and stern. There was misery in the
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 115 -->
village; the men had no work; and the old people
began to die.


The squire's lady with the dark eyes came to
them no more. The servants, as they sat round
the kitchen fire, could no longer listen to her sweet
voice from the little room up-stairs. They seldom
saw her now. They saw her only at the family
meals, eating and drinking but enough to preserve
her life; or at prayer-time, sitting pale and silent,
with her eyes drooped and her thin hands resting
on each other; sometimes she went out into the
stable-yard to throw down crumbs for the starving
birds; sometimes they saw her in the shrubbery,
walking slowly, thinly clad, unmindful of the cold,
looking before her with fixed and vacant eyes.


The maids spoke in whispers of their ill-treated
lady; of the woman who worked them so hard, who
stinted them of fire and food, and who when they
gave warning refused to give them characters; of
the master, about whom there was something wrong;
and of the smooth-tongued butler, who spied them
so closely as he read the Bible in the kitchen, and
who kept pieces of ice wrapped up in blankets in his
own room.  
  
  
  I 2
<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 116 -->

After the quarrel, and the mysterious incident by
which it had been followed, and which still perplexed
Maddalena, Miss Atkins had not spoken to her. She
had concentrated her energies upon the subjugation
of her brother's mind; she had caressed him with
delicate and assiduous attentions, inspired, not by
love for him, but by hatred for Maddalena. If she
found them talking together, she invented a pretext
for taking him away; she declared to him that she
could never be friendly with his wife again; not
because they had had words together, but because
she had, by her violence, endangered the life of the
brother whom she loved so much.


Maddalena cared little for this; she escaped the
petty annoyances with which she had been teased.
She was left alone with her great miseries.


She used to sit all day long in her little room; it
was very cold, but she could play there as well as
sing. She possessed a large library of music, among
which were many instrumental pieces; she
determined to make herself a pianist. Dr. Darlington
had told her that with her delicate constitution she
must never depend upon her voice; that, powerful
as it was, she must lose it from ill-health. " I must
<!-- Leaf 125, Page: 117 -->
have other accomplishments," she said to herself, and
played or sang nearly all day long. And once a
day she went into the village with medicines or
broths, the only things which she had ever asked
her husband for. Thus occupied, she was as happy
as she had ever been since her marriage.


But Miss Atkins began to suffer from headaches.
She lay on the sofa during three successive days.
She complained of the noise of the piano, and that
Maddalena's screams, as she called them, went
through her brain. Atkins told this to his wife,
and requested her to discontinue her exercises for a
little while.


Maddalena took refuge among the cottagers. They
were glad enough to hear her sing. She learnt some
of the old country songs, with their rude but plaintive
airs. She sang lullabies to children in their cradles.
The old people liked her to sing them the Evening
Hymn.


But presently she found that they received her
with constraint, and seemed relieved when she rose
to go; that they never asked her to sing; that they
answered her with short words, and with
downturned eyes; that the children who had formerly
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 118 -->
come round her as soon as she entered the village,
and climbed upon her lap as soon as she sat down,
now ran away and hid themselves from her; and a
mother would call them and gather them round her
when she approached, as a hen calls her chickens
under the coop when a hawk appears in the air; and
people clustered together and whispered, and pointed
at her with the finger from afar; and the sick made
excuses for not drinking the broth which she brought
down from the house, and which she warmed over
their fires with her own hands.


In time she discovered what this meant. Miss
Atkins had been there. She had whispered in every
ear that Maddalena was a Papist; that she was a
female Jesuit in disguise. The word Jesuit has still
terrors for many persons in England even of the
educated classes; the word Papist is still associated
by the lower order of minds with Gunpowder Plots
and Smithfield Fires. There happened to be no
Catholic family in that district; the simple villagers
had heard only of our religion through ignorant
parsons and lying tracts. Ungrateful and suspicious
as peasants always are, they gave ready credence to
this calumny against their benefactress, and detected
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 119 -->
a scheme in her kind services. Thus her voice and
her charity were silenced. She could only throw
crumbs to the birds.


It would be difficult to define her husband's
feelings towards her. His infatuation, made up of
passion and vanity, had passed; there was little gold
left when the mind was washed away. Besides, his
mind was beginning to succumb beneath a malady
from which he had suffered all his life; he was
completely under the domination of his sister, who
began to rule him with a stern hand, and he dared not
openly sympathise with one whom she hated and
oppressed.


But one dim winter morning when she rose from
his side and began to dress, her teeth chattering
with cold; when he saw how that form once so
beautiful had changed; when he saw her dwindled,
shrivelled breast, her thin arms, the bones
protruding from her neck, her hair which as she
combed it came out in tufts; her forehead furrowed
by long deep lines; her pinched features, and her
eyes which seemed ever filled with the vapour of
tears, he felt a pang of pity and remorse. He took
hold of her passive hand. " Ah, Maddalena!" he
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 120 -->
said; " I fear that you would have been happier if
you had married that Italian, than you ai*e with me."

He felt her hand throb in his. " What Italian ?"

she cried.


\"The one who used to visit you so often when I
knew you first."


Then observing her bewildered look, he said,
\"What a fool I am ! No doubt that was another

of your father's lies. And yet no, it could not have
been; he showed me the letter; it was in Italian,
but he told me I might keep it if I chose."


She did not dare nor care to ask him more.
She pondered deeply on those words. She made
her mind dwell in the past; at first all was dark;
then, as the eyes of a prisoner in a dungeon
acquire a power above those of other men, her mind
became gifted with a strange lucidity and
penetration. The dark became clear; the hidden became
visible; the forgotten returned to life. Words and
looks, seen but unobserved, arrayed themselves before
her. She saw the shadow of a plot upon the wall.


When the mind interred in deep solitude centres
itself upon one thought and pursues it without
ceasing, there are no obstacles which it cannot
<!-- Leaf 129, Page: 121 -->
overcome. It was thus, as Newton himself said, his
gigantic discoveries were made; it was thus that
Maddalena worked out a problem which held the
same place in her mind as the gravitation theory
in that of the great astronomer. She recollected
that her father had cursed Eugenio the first night
after he had seen him; he had began by hating
him. She also recollected that on the night he had
returned covered with dirt and worn with fatigue,
he had muttered something about revenge. Her
mind had been filled with Eugenio then; she had
reflected little of the cause of her father's strangeness
at the time. She had supposed that he had been
so troubled because he had lost at the Tombola, in
spite of his dream, and had not returned home
because he was ashamed to confess it to her. She had
now little doubt that Eugenio had reproached him
as bitterly and imprudently as he had afterwards
done when she was present. She recalled to mind
a host of little things besides which proved that her
father hated him intensely.


She had heard by accident that Julie, after
leaving her service had entered that of the Baroness
Sackowsky. This gave her the clue. It was her
<!-- Leaf 130, Page: 122 -->
father who had procured the dismissal of her maid;
she had frequently observed that there appeared to
be some secret understanding between him and
Julie; but for a long time she could get no farther
than this. It happened, however, that Miss Atkins
had put away, in a cupboard in her brother's
bedroom, a number of old tattered books, which seemed
too worthless to send up to London to sell.
Maddalena rummaging among these had found an
oldfashioned romance in a blue paper binding, such as
used to fill the circulating libraries years ago. It
was a story of two lovers whom a jealous woman had
separated by means of forged and intercepted letters.
She saw it all now; she had put no letter for
Eugenio in the post herself; and her own letters
came always through her father's hands. She
remembered how unwilling her father had been that
she should keep the letter from Eugenio to the
Baroness Sackowsky; how earnestly he had begged
her to destroy it. She opened a little desk, and
took out some relics of her love. These were a lock
of his hair which she had cut off when he was
taking a siesta, with his head upon her lap; a
flower which he had plucked for her off a hedge;
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 123 -->
and the letter itself, which was discoloured by her
tears. She examined it carefully, gave a cry of
delight and then of pain. Women often spoil their
most elaborate schemes by some silly negligence,
and this letter had been written upon Olga
Sackowsky's own paper. But this was superfluous evidence.
The date of the letter reminded her that at that
time Eugenio had given her a chamber on the first
floor, and slept himself on the floor above. Between
the two floors, as usual in Florentine houses, was
an iron gate upon the stairs. This was locked
every night when they went to-bed; and the servant
every morning at daybreak came to her for the
key. Thus Eugenio had been really a prisoner
during the night; he could not possibly have left
the house.


She reproached herself bitterly for not having
thought of this before. " How easily," thought she,
\"I believed ill of him who was always so good to
me." Then she sighed; she had doubtless been
calumniated to him as well. They had told him
that she did not care for him; that she wished to
marry this man for his money. How could she
blame him for having broken his word, for having
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 124 -->
returned to the Baroness Sackowsky ? He had
believed her equally faithless, equally perjured, and
led away, not by tbe temptations of pleasure, but by
a sordid love of gold. " Oh, Eugenio ! Eugenio !"
she cried; " what must you think of me now ! "


One morning ere she woke, she dreamt that she
was with him again. They were seated upon the
marble bench. It was the hour of dusk. She saw
the cypresses, which cast deep shadows upon the
earth; she heard the loved chimes of the city from
below, she felt the warm Italian air upon her cheeks.
She dreamt that she saw him; that he was gazing
on her tenderly, with all the old love in his look,
that she flung her arms round him, and cried,
\"Dearest, dearest, thou art mine now, and we must
part no more." Then she awoke, and heard these
last words dying on her tongue. She found her head
upon her husband's breast, her arms round him, and
his cold grey eyes looking down in astonishment
upon her face. She murmured, " I was dreaming !"
and slowly wound herself away. She turned hot and
cold. Had she spoken his name in her sleep?
This must not happen again. The next night, under
the plea of indisposition, she slept in her little room,
<!-- Leaf 133, Page: 125 -->
which she left no more. He did not remonstrate,
and from that time they ceased to be husband and
wife, except in name.


She now thought of Eugenio all day long. Even
when she slept her heart remained awake; she dreamt
continually of him. She wandered out in the woods
that she might sing the airs which he had taught
her. He had once written his name on the fly-leaf of
her missal; she tore this out and wore it always
in her bosom; she looked forward eagerly to the
hour of rest, quivering with impatience through the
long and weary evening prayers; then she would
undress herself quickly, blow out the light, and
glide in between the cold white sheets with
shivering limbs and a palpitating heart. And as soon as
the bed grew warm, her brain opened, and the
memories of the past came round her; and wild,
wicked, voluptuous thoughts, encouraged by the
silence and solitude of the night, stole forth, and
poured whispers in her ears.


She determined to leave her husband and return
upon the stage. When she had earned some money,
she would find Eugenio; she would become his
slave, his mistress, whatever he pleased; she would
<!-- Leaf 134, Page: 126 -->
never leave him again. Her father should not
come near them; she would give up all for him—
her honour as a wife, her duty as a daughter, her
modesty as a woman.


Then she would start back in horror from these
wicked thoughts; and return to them, muttering
with compressed lips, "It is not my fault; I have
been deceived; I have been bought and sold; I have
been persecuted; I am driven to desperation; on
then heads shall be my sins."


She did not know that a divorce can be obtained
so much more easily in England than in Italy. She
saw little hope of ever being released from the
shackles which bound her to her husband. But
wherever there is mystery there is hope. She often
reflected upon the scene which had taken place after
her quarrel with Jane Atkins. And again it
happened, at least so she thought. She was in the
dining-room by herself, when she heard a violent
ringing of bells; the shrill voice of Jane Atkins
called for ice; there was a running of feet in the
hall; she heard a heavy body fall upon the echoing
stone floor; she ran to the door, but at the same
moment it was bolted from outside; she heard the
<!-- Leaf 135, Page: 127 -->
sound of whisperings, and of feet which trod slowly
and heavily as if something was being carried away.
The door was unbolted, and she went up to her
room.


She laid down upon the bed that she might think.
She heard subdued voices and cautious footsteps in
the next room, and the plashing of water, and
sometimes she caught words from Miss Atkins, such as,
\"Let me do it!" and " It is over now! "


She remembered how her husband had changed
since she had seen him first; how ill he looked;
how carefully his sister watched him. It was plain
that he suffered from some disease, which attacked
him suddenly and fiercely, and which was gradually
wasting his life away. Then there settled on her
mind a horrible thought, vulture-like, with bright
yellow eyes, and a naked neck, and a hard, hooked
beak, emitting a carrion stench, and having its
feathers stained with blood. She sprang up in bed,
her body crouched, her neck protruding, and looked
round her with glittering eyes. She might soon be
free !  
  
  
  Miss Atkins had remarked that for a long time
<!-- Leaf 136, Page: 128 -->
past Maddalena had changed. Her face had lost
its eternal expression of lassitude and unconcern.
It was at times brighter, at times darker, than it
had ever been before. She was certain that there
must be some reason for this, and spied her
industriously, but without avail.


She was now seated by her brother's side. He
was asleep. On a table by the bed was a basin of
water, a lump of half-melted ice, and a handkerchief
covered with blood and foam. Jane Atkins having
assured herself that he was sleeping, took off her
boots, and went on tip-toe to the door which led
into Maddalena's room. Putting aside a coat which
hung upon a peg, she pulled out of the door a little
wooden plug, and applied her eye to the aperture.
She saw Maddalena kneeling before the picture of
the Madonna of the SevenDolors. Her eyes were
streaming with tears, and she was saying something
in a troubled voice. But it was in Italian, and she
could not understand. But presently she saw
Maddalena take a piece of paper from her bosom
and tear it into pieces; then open a desk, take out
two other letters, and also tear them up; something
which semed to be a faded flower she pinched
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 129 -->
between her fingers, it crumbled into dust, which
she shook from her hands upon the floor. She was
speaking all the while, and often said the word
\"Eugenio !"


Presently she became more composed; glancing
at the sun which was about to set, she took from
the mantelpiece a little saucer filled with oil, on the
surface of which floated a cotton wick. She lighted
the wick, and chanted in a low voice some Latin
words. When the tiny light died out, she replaced
the saucer on the mantelpiece, climbed on a chair,
kissed the picture of the Madonna on the lips,
and putting on her bonnet and cloak left the
room.


It was now spring. There had been several sunny
days, and the evening was quite warm. The rooks
cawing loudly had begun to build their nests; the
finches flew in pairs; the horse-chestnuts had
blossomed; one lilac tree was already in flower, and
Maddalena found in the shrubbery a tuft of
primroses expanding their golden flowers amid velvety
green leaves.


Her face was calm and bright. She had been to
vespers : she had confessed her sins; and she was  
  
  
  VOL. It. K
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 130 -->
about to begin another life. She would be kind
and attentive to her husband, and would nurse him
when he was ill. She would think no more of
Eugenio; these memories which so long had been
her companions were evil spirits; she would drive
them all away. She would continue to suffer, but
she would not sin; and she hoped that her sorrows
in this life would be the seeds of happiness in the
life to come.


But the dark shades of evening came round her;
a cold wind arose from the east; she wrapped her
shawl closely round her, and hurried towards the
house; some drops of rain began to fall, and the
trees groaning shook their branches as she passed
beneath.


On arriving at the house, she felt in her pocket
for her key. It was not there; she must have left
it in the door. She had a presentiment, and ran
quickly up the stairs. Her fears were confirmecL
The crucifix had been broken; the picture of the
Madonna lay in shreds upon the floor. Even her
cushion, her little saucer, and her books of devotion
had been destroyed. She sat for several minutes
completely stupefied on the edge of the bed. She
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 131 -->
picked up the fragments of her poor idols, one by
one, and placed them on the table, looking at them
with vacant eyes. Then she gave a stifled cry:
her face flushed: she flung open the casement and
cried :—


\"It is then a Devil who rules up there and not
a God. You refuse my repentance! You wish to
drive me to despair ! So be it: so be it. I have
had enough of this."


She dipped her face in water, arranged her dress,
and walked slowly down the stairs. When her pale,
stern face appeared at the door, Atkins shuddered,
and his sister for a moment felt afraid.


She advanced to the table, and placed upon it
some pieces of the picture, the crucifix, and the
books. Then she turned her eyes to Jane Atkins,
and said, pointing to them,  
  
  
  " It was you."  
  
  
  " Yes, it was I."  
  
  
  Maddalena turned to her husband, and said :


\"From this moment, sir, I cease to be your wife.
To-morrow I shall leave you for ever. You have
done me no harm yourself; but you have not
resisted the cruelty of this woman against me as you  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 140, Page: 132 -->
should have done. I leave you with her : she must
torture some one; and you will be punished enough.
May God help you. But I can no longer bear it.
She has my life between her hands, and is squeezing
the blood out of it drop by drop."


He was about to speak, when his sister
interrupted him. " It's no use talking, Richard. If you
want her to stop, you can make her stop. If she
runs away, you can bring her back. The law puts
her in your power."


\"Be quiet, Jane," said Atkins. " You have done
enough for one day, and I must teach you that you
are not to remain always mistress in this house.
That right belongs to my wife. I see plainly enough
that you cannot both remain here; and to-morrow
you will have to go. Ay, and by the first train,"
he said, in a louder voice, and answering her look;
\"so you had better pack up your things at once."


\"No, no, Mr. Atkins," said Maddalena, softening.
\"Your sister will attend to you—I think you are
sometimes ill, are you not ?—better than I can do.
She has more experience. I cannot live with her
any longer, but I am sure I forgive her from my
heart."
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 133 -->

Her husband took her hand in his. "
Maddalena," he said, " do not leave me. I shall not be ill
many more times now, and you will not mind
nursing me a little, will you, dear ? I do not think
that I have long to live. Maddalena, I have behaved
badly to you; you have been very miserable here :
and so have I. But we will not stop here : you shall
take me to Italy, perhaps the sun will do me good;
and you shall have your father with you if you like,
and let him gamble ! I have money enough, God
knows, and it will be no use to me when I am gone."


Maddalena drew the poor creature towards her,
and kissed him for the first time. " Yes, yes," she
said, " I will stop with you; but you must not talk
like that."


\"Ah, Maddalena," he whispered, " I am going,
going, very fast. But I want before I die to wipe
away some of the wrongs which I have done to you. I
have often wondered what was that love which people
wrote about in books. I think that I can understand
it a little now. I don't know how it is, but I've
become quite changed of late. I don't care for
money now. I like to look at the sky, and wonder
what goes on up there. The other day I hid myself
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 134 -->
in the shrubbery to hear you sing, and your voice
made me cry like a child. Something seems opened
in me now. Maddalena dear, you will stop with me,
will you not ? "


\"Yes, Richard," she said, " I will stop with you,
and your sister may stop too."  
  
  
  " No, no," he said, " let her go; we will give her  
  
  
  plenty of money : that is what she likes better than

me."  
  
  
  Then he gave a smile.


\"You never called me Richard before; but we
mean to be quite different to each other now. You
shall sing to me, and read'to me out of nice books;
and when my time comes you shall smile on me,
and press my hand and sing to me the Evening
Hymn. Ah! I remember your singing it to poor
Sally Brewer when she was so ill,—  
  
  
  ' Teach me to live that I may dread
The grave as little as my bed;
Teach me to die that so I may
Rise joyful on the judgment day.'

Yes, yes, the words seemed to strike me then,—the
words seemed to strike me then;" and he began
to twirl his fingers and mutter to himself, and to
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 135 -->
look about him in all directions with his glassy
eyes.


His sister, chafing with rage, at length exclaimed:
\"Well, Richard, you may do as you please, of course;
I have no desire to stop in the house along with a
heathen and a fool. But I have done my duty in
breaking her graven images, and I shall do it in
something else before I go."


She turned round to Maddalena, and transfixing
her with a look, she said :


\"I was listening at the door this afternoon, when
you were talking to your dear picture. I heard
every word you said. Here, Richard, as you seem
so anxious to please your wife, I tell you what you
can do. Let her send for a gentleman called
Eugenio."


Miss Atkins shot in the dark, but her arrow went
through a heart. Maddalena fainted away.


When she came to her senses, she was lying
dressed upon her bed, with two of her maids seated
by. She sent them away, that she might have her
face at liberty, and be able to think without
restraint.
<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 136 -->

When Maddalena had knelt before the Madonna,
she had confessed herself. She had called herself a
murderess, because for a moment she had looked
forward with joy to her husband's death; an
adulteress, because she had allowed the memory of
Eugenio to deflower and defile her mind : she had
confessed herself as she could not have confessed to
a priest; she had confessed not only her thoughts,
but her sensations. Forgetting that though she
had spoken aloud, she had spoken in Italian, she
believed that Jane Atkins had really heard all, and
by this time doubtless had repeated every word to
her brother. Maddalena was extremely sensitive
and proud; she felt that she could not dare to look
at them again. Most women probably would have
felt the same.


She went to the window, opened the casement,
fastened the hasp, and leaning her elbows on
the sill, her head upon her hands, gazed out upon
the night. The wind struck her, and the sleet
dashed sharply in her face. Then she lifted up her
voice and cried :


\"Eternal Mother of God, I desert my duty; I
turn my back upon this poor dying man. But
<!-- Leaf 145, Page: 137 -->
tell Him what I suffer, and pray Him to forgive
me."


She looked down into the park. There stood the
giant trees, brandishing their huge limbs in the
wind, and casting flickering shadows upon the earth.
She looked out beyond into the fields. A white
hand-post stood like a ghost with one arm
outstretched. It pointed towards a yellow light which,
scarcely visible in the distance, appeared and
disappeared like a star. It was the Cullingford Railway
Station four miles away.


And as she stood there the owl flew by, flapping
his great grey wings. " Oh, there is death upon this
house ! " she cried.  
  
  
  A dog howled.


\"Oh, Eugenio, Eugenio, thou art the curse of my
life !" She stretched out her arms in the air. A
dead leaf fell in her hand.


\"Hark ! " what is that dull murmur which grows
louder and louder till it is almost a roar, and which
rolls like thunder past the light.  
  
  
  It is the night-mail.


\"That fight is a beacon," she cried; " that sound
is a voice. They tell me to escape from here."
<!-- Leaf 146, Page: 138 -->

Without undressing, she laid herself down upon
the bed, to wait till it was dawn. But she began
to doze, and presently fell into a kind of
wakingsleep; she still saw the candle, but it seemed to her
to be the station-light; she heard the moaning of
the wind, and half thought, half dreamt that it was
the murmur of the train.


Her sleep became deeper, and her visions became
more wild. Yet neither eyes nor ears were closed.
When the house swayed in the wind, she dreamt
that she was in the train, which rocked from side
to side; when the owl fluttered against the
window, attracted by the light, she saw a white
fleshless face which peered in and gibbered at her.
Then she dreamt that the engine whistled, but
its whistle was like a human shriek. She awoke
with a start, and looked round her. The candle
had burnt down into the socket; a little flame
leapt up, and it went out. She became broad
awake, and sat up in the bed, but all was silent
now. She reflected on her dream. Was it a real
shriek which she had heard ? It had seemed so
real, and yet so unlike anything which she had
ever heard before. It still rang in her ears. Then
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 139 -->
she laughed at herself. How could it have been
anything but a dream ?


She went to the window and looked out. She
thought that the trees seemed clearer than before.
Presently she saw the brown clouds turn grey; she
could see the distant fields, and a mist hanging over
them like smoke. She washed herself, changed her
dress, and put on a pair of thick boots. She listened
once more at her husband's door; there was not a
sound. She knelt down at the bed, wept a short
prayer, then opened her door softly, crept down the
stairs, stole across the wide stone floor of the hall,
lifted with difficulty the iron bar, unloosed the
chain, took down the bells, unshot the bolts, and
wrapping a handkerchief round her hand turned the
huge key. She opened the door, which creaked
loudly, and closed it after her, that her flight might
not be discovered as soon as the servants rose. She
breathed more freely as soon as she was outside the
house. The cold air refreshed her like a bath.


She ran like a doe down the broad gravel drive,
avoided the lodge by climbing over the iron rails,
crossing the park, and leaping the sunken fence
which separated it from the road.
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 140 -->

She walked as quickly as she could along the road
between the fields. When she passed the hand-post
she smiled, and shuddered as she remembered her
fears and fancies of the night before, which the
daylight had quite dispelled. After walking a quarter of
a mile the road dipped down between two high chalk
banks. She looked back at the house, trembling;
but the shutters were still before all the windows,
and in a few more steps it was hidden from her
sight. After another quarter of a mile she emerged
again into the open fields. Straight before her was
the station with its signal-posts rising in the air.
As she followed the road she found that it bent away
to the right; she tried to walk across the ploughed
fields, but every moment she sank up to her ankles
in the clay. She returned to the road and went on
for about two miles. Then she saw that it was
leading her towards a line of willow trees, with here
and there a cottage peeping out, and soon she caught
sight of a blue river. She now recollected that the

Thames ran between her and the station, and that
when she had come with her husband in the fly,
they had made a wide detour, and passed through
the town of Cullingford, the spires of which she saw
<!-- Leaf 149, Page: 141 -->
rising among elms far away to the right. " I am
lost!" she cried to herself. " They will overtake me
long before I can get there."


She met a man dressed in a smock-frock, and with
his corduroy trousers tied with whip-cord to raise
them from his boots. It was a farm labourer going
to his work.


\"My good man," she said, " I want to go to the
railway-station; will you tell me the shortest way?"


The man stared at her, and drawled out, "Bee
a-going up by the first train, baint 'ee ? "


\"Yes, yes," she said impatiently, " by the first
train; which is the way ? "


"He must walk danged quick to catch it then,"
said the rustic, with a knowing air. " It'll soon be
due, and they don't take long a comin', trains
do-ant."


\"Then please tell me which is the quickest way,
for I want to lose no time."


\"No, that 'ee do-ant, I'll be bound for't. Well, I
don't think 'ee can go no shorter road than the
ferry. 'Ee can cut across the fields, and get 'ver the
brige, 'ee know, only it baint allowed, and p'rhaps
they'll pull 'ee up for it. They be rare uns for
<!-- Leaf 150, Page: 142 -->
that them railway chaps. My brother Jem's allers
for doin' everything in such a mortial hurry, ye
know—can't take things easy, loike; so, one day
he was comin' whoam from Reading Fair, and when
he gets to Cullingford ste-ation, out he jumps afore
the train had done movin', and broke his leg, and
were a matter of six weeks in the horsepital, and
then they pulls he up and makes him pay two
pounds for't—that they did—as if he'd done
anybody any hurt except hisself."


"But please tell me where the ferry is," said
Maddalena.


"What, doant 'ee know where the feriy be!
Coom, coom, 'ee be a jokin'."  
  
  
  "I am not, indeed. Please tell me where it  
  
  
  *■>

is:


\"Get along with 'ee—wanting to make fun o' a
poor old man. Whoy, everybody knows the ferry
here for modes round."


\"But I am a stranger here, and I do not know my
way—I do not indeed."


\"Well, this road'll take 'ee straight to't; but
there, you knows that as well as I do, I'll be bound
for't."
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 143 -->
  
  " Thank you, thank you," said she, and hurried

on.


When she arrived at the ferry the man and boat
were on the other side. The people at the cottage
rang a bell, and the ferryman was pointed out to her
fishing under a stunted willow. Having waited a
few moments to see if a nibble would become a bite,
he leisurely got up, inspected his bait, shook his
head, twisted the line round his rod and laid it on
the grass with as much care as if it had been alive.
Then he got into the boat, unchained it slowly, and
allowed the current to carry it across, sometimes
touching the water with his oars. Quivering with
impatience she sprang into the boat, and begged him
to row quickly as she wished to catch the early
train. He assured her that she had plenty of time.
As soon as the boat touched the other side she
jumped out and hastened off as quickly as she could.
Presently she heard him running after her. She
turned round. "'Beg pardon, inarm," said he,
touching his cap; " it's Mrs. Atkins of Vachell, ain't
it ? " She replied that it was; and the man
apparently perfectly contented went back to his nibbling
perch. What could this mean ? thought she.
<!-- Leaf 152, Page: 144 -->

In ten minutes, by running more than half the
way, she arrived at the Cullingford Road Station.
The porter touched his cap to her with a dubious
air.  
  
  
  " When does the early train come in ? " she asked.


\"Due in a quarter of an hour, ma'am—up train, I
suppose you mean ? "  
  
  
  " Yes," she said, vaguely, " the up-train."


\"Other side of the platform, please ma'am. Shall
I get your ticket for you ?"


\"Oh, my ticket," she replied; " yes, if you please
—at least, thank you, no—I will get it myself." And
she went into the ticket-office.


The station-master looked veiy much surprised
when he saw Mrs. Atkins of Vachell come in, her dress
and boots covered with mud, and without a maid.


\"Does this train go to London, please, sir ?" she
asked.


The man immediately became the mere official.
"Ticket for Paddington — first-class, I suppose,
ma'am — nine shillings and fourpence, if you
please."


Maddalena turned red, and then very pale. She
now understood why the ferryman had asked her
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 145 -->
name. She had not thought of bringing any money
with her, nor indeed had she any in her possession.
What was she to do ? The want of those few
shillings were fatal to her. Then taking off her
brooch, she offered it to the station-master, and said,
\"I am sorry, sir, but I have forgotten my purse, and
I must go by this train—I must indeed. Will you
take this till I can send you the money ?"


\"Lor, ma'am," said the man, getting red in his
turn, " there's no call for that; we know you well
enough, I should think. You can settle that when
you come down. Was it a single ticket you wanted,
or a return ?"


"This will do," said Maddalena, taking the one
which he had stamped, " and I am very much obliged
to you, sir."


"Don't mention it, ma'am; and pray sit down by
the fire; you must be a-cold."  
  
  
  But Maddalena could not sit down. She wandered

up and down the platform, sometimes stopping
before the office-door to glance at the clock;
sometimes she went to the station gate and looked down
the Cullingford Road. A cart in the distance made
her thoroughly wretched for five minutes. She  
  
  
  VOL. n.  
  
  
  L
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 146 -->
expected every moment that some one would be sent
after her from Vachell.


That long thin hand of time, how slowly it turned.
The clock struck at last, but no train came.


She had now a fresh cause of anxiety, and called
the porter to her. "Was there an accident on
the rafl, did he think? Why did not the train
come ?"


The porter reassured her. The lines were
slippery after the rain; that most in general made the
train a matter late. How long, he could not say—
not for certain. But if there'd been an accident it
would have been telegraphed to them, no doubt.


Maddalena looked up at the long thin wires which,
stretched from post to post, were humming in the
wind. The good-natured porter guessing that she had
some reason for being so restless and impatient, took
her up a little eminence at the end of the platform
close by the red brick arch. Thence they could look
a long way along the glittering metal lines which
seemed to meet in a point about five miles off. The
porter discoursed topographically upon this " bit of
road." Maddalena heard little of what he said tUl
the words " Here she comes " made her start up from
<!-- Leaf 155, Page: 147 -->
her thoughts. She saw a white speck which became
a cloud, and out of this cloud came a black stern
thing, which grew larger and larger without
appearing to move, and which, to her disturbed fancy,
resembled something monstrous, and alive. When
it whistled she thought of the shriek; and as it
passed she trembled more than the platform on
which she stood.


The station-master came out and opened the door
of the ladies' carriage himself. She sprang in hastily.
The train remained three minutes; it seemed an
age to her. A conversation which the porter held
with the guard about a parcel, she thought was
protracted on purpose to annoy her. She scowled at
the man when he put in his head at the -window, to
:see if she was comfortable, and touched his cap with
a smde, which seemed to her a sardonic grin. When
the train was fairly off she had a moment of intense
relief, but her eyes fell on the telegraph wires, and
her torments recommenced. She remembered what
the porter had said about telegraphing. The tram
would not arrive in London for two hours yet. Before
that time her husband would surely trace her to the
station, and the porter would advise him to intercept  
  
  
  i. 2
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 148 -->
her by a message. She did not feel really safe till
she had ensconced herself in the corner of a cab, and
told the man to drive to Dr. Darlington's address.
But her troubles were not yet over. Darlington was
not at home; the servant thought that she would
find him at the hospital.


The cab stopped before an immense building of
sombre aspect, like a prison or a workhouse. She
passed through swinging doors into a large stone
hall, in which a crowd of sickly wretches were
collected. A man in a dingy livery came up to her,
and said—  
  
  
  " Got a letter ?"  
  
  
  " No," stammered Maddalena, " but I want to—'


\"All right," said the man, " house-surgeon will
attend to you. Now then," said he, turning to
another, " what do you want ? "


Maddalena, in a splashed and shabby dress, had
been mistaken by the porter for an out-patient.
Despairing of obtaining- any information from this
man, she went on with the crowd which struggled
up a flight of broad stone steps. At the top of
these stood a knot of young men who were
talking and laughing, and staring very hard at the
<!-- Leaf 157, Page: 149 -->
females who passed. Maddalena had the courage to
ask one ot them where she could find thehousesurgeon.


\"Now then, Jenkins," said one of them, " why
don't you attend to the young woman ?"


\"Where can you find the house-surgeon, ma'am ?"
said the gentleman addressed, " well, if you were to
go into that little room there opposite, you would
find the house-surgeon eating hot buttered toast, and
kissing a Sister of Charity; but as he might not like
that, you had better go into the room to the left, and
wait with the rest of them tdl your turn comes."


Maddalena went into the patients' waiting-room.
Presently a bell rang, and a woman passed through
an inner door into a room beyond. After a few
minutes the bell rang again. Maddalena looked
round her. There were thirty people there at least;
if she stayed there till the last she would probably
be detained two hours. So she slipped in at the
half-open door, just before a ragged old woman, who
was tottering towards it, and who exclaimed, in a
tone of bitter irony, " Well, you have a nerve."


"Maddalena found herself confronting a young
gentleman, who sat before a table with a pile of
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 150 -->
recipe papers on one hand, an open case of
instruments on the other, and a hand-bell before him.
There were some bottles on the mantelpiece, some
printed rules in frames upon the walls, and at the
other side of the room a bedstead, half-hidden by a

screen.


\"Well," he said, in a sharp quick voice. " What
is it?"


\"If you please, sir, I want to see Dr.
Darlington."


The house-surgeon rang the bell. " Next
patient! This is not Dr. Darlington's
day—Mondays and Thursdays, at half-past one. Well, mother,
how are you to-day ? "


\"But pray tell me, sir, where I can find him. I
wish to see him particularly. I have been to his
house, and the servant said that he would be
here."


The house-surgeon looked at her more attentively,
saw that she was a lady, and said to another man in
dingy livery, " Here, Jones, private patient for Dr.
Darlington; see if he's in the house."


The man took her to the porter, who informed her
that the Doctor had just gone. "If the case is
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 151 -->
hurgent," said he, "I can give you his private
address."  
  
  
  " I have just come from his house," she said.


"Well, but he's most likely gone home," said the
porter; " it aint often he' comes up here at this
hour. Here comes Dr. Rudderforth, perhaps he
will know."


Maddalena looked up, and saw a short,
freshcoloured man, with spectacles and grey hair, coming
down the passage at a trot. As he passed by the
two young men they took their hats off, and when
he had passed looked at each other and laughed.
The spectacles caught sight of the porter's finger
pointing towards him, and bustled up to
Maddalena.  
  
  
  Anything I can do for you, ma'am ?"  
  
  
  :' I wish to find Dr. Darlington."


\"All right, come with me; just going to meet
him in consultation. Jump into the carriage. That
your cab ? John, pay the lady's cab. Give him
half of what he asks; and if he wants my card, let
him have another sixpence."


In two minutes Maddalena found herself rolling
along at a rapid pace. Dr. Rudderforth plunged his
<!-- Leaf 160, Page: 152 -->
hand into the pockets of the carriage, which were
stuffed with pamphlets, letters, and printer's proofs,
and began correcting some of the latter with a lead
pencil. In a little while the carriage stopped before
a house in Sussex Square.


"I'll send him down to you," said the doctor,
springing out.


\"Good God, Maddalena," said Darlington,
appearing at the carriage window, " what is the meaning of
this?"  
  
  
  Maddalena burst into tears.


\"Do not cry," he said. " I will be with you in
five minutes; the consultation will not last long."


He came back in five minutes' time, put her into his
carriage, and said " Home. Now, my dear girl," he
said, tenderly taking her hand, "tell me all about it."  
  
  
  She told him all except the last scenes.


He shook his head and muttered,—"Women are
like children; whenever they are unhappy they run
away from home."


He looked at his watch. " Now/ my dear," he
said, " you have two hours to eat a good breakfast,
and to rest. Then you must go back."  
  
  
  " Go back ! " she cried. " It is impossible !"
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 153 -->

He remonstrated with her, but in vain, and was
compelled to try his last resource.


\"Maddalena," he said, " have I ever done you an
injury?"


\"Oh, my friend," she exclaimed, "you have covered
me with kindnesses !"


\"Well," he said, " you are doing me now the worst
injury you possibly can."  
  
  
  " Oh, do not say that."


\"And perhaps you will ruin me for life. Do you
not see how fatally you will compromise me if you
will not consent to go back. Your sister-in-law, you
say, has invented a scandal against us, as it is. Now
when it comes to be known that you ran away from
your husband and came to me, what will the world
say ? It will not believe that we are merely friends,
for the world does not believe in exceptions. The
affair will get into the newspapers, and my
reputation will be gone for ever. The world condemns as
a crime in priests and in doctors that which it regards
as a folly in other men, and the world is just. The
doctor who abuses the confidence of a family is the
worst of all traitors. Maddalena, do not expose me to
such an accusation."
<!-- Leaf 162, Page: 154 -->

\"Say no more," she said, sadly; " I will go
back."


"I will go with you," he said, "and you will
make up some story to account for this escapade.
But you must not live with these people any more.
They will kill you, my poor child."


Maddalena did not reply; and during the long
journey home did not utter a word.


On arriving at Cullingford Road, she requested
Darlington to repay the station-master. Darlington
noticed that the man seemed astonished at
Maddalena's return, and eyed her in a curious manner.
She observed nothing. Her eyes were drooped; her
sufferings had begun. To some it may seem a
trifle, but this proud girl in consenting to return
performed the noblest action of her life. Some
ladies who had come down by the same train, and
whom a carriage had come to meet, were looking at
Maddalena, and whispering together. They were
the daughter of a neighbouring squire who had
taken them up to town the previous season.  
  
  
  " That is Restoni," said one of them.


\"Heavens, what a fright! " said another. " And
she was not at all bad-looking on the stage."
<!-- Leaf 163, Page: 155 -->

\"Yes; but that was all make-up. The creature
is as plain as she can be."


They took small pains to lower their voices, and
Maddalena heard eveiy one of these cruel words.
They distressed her little at the time, but she had
occasion afterwards to recall them to her mind.


\"Why, what a curious thing !" exclaimed
Darlington, as the fly passed through the lodge-gate,
\"All the blinds are down."


Maddalena did not answer him; she had not
heard what he said.


As they drove up to the front door, Miss Atkins
came out of the house.


\"What!" she cried, with a fearful look at
Maddalena, " you have dared to return ? "


Maddalena did not answer, but stood before her
humbly, with her eyes lowered, and her hands
folded together.  
  
  
  " Dared to return, madam!" said Darlington,

haughtily. " I am at a loss to understand what you
mean."


"Possibly," she retorted, with a sneer; "but you
will soon."  
  
  
  The servants came crowding on each other to the
<!-- Leaf 164, Page: 156 -->
door, peeping- over each other's shoulders, and
whispering stealthily together.


"Here they are, ma'am," said the butler,
pointing to the gate. " It's them right enough this
time."


Darlington looked up and saw a gig drawn by a
powerful horse coming at a great speed down the
drive. It contained two men. One of them was
an ordinary-looking person, with red hair and a
hideous freckled face. The other was a shortcompact little man, with keen brown eyes, an intelligent
face, and a high massive forehead. As he stepped
down from the gig, he took off his hat to
Darmgton.  
  
  
  " What, Simcox ! " exclaimed the doctor,  
  
  
  " Yes, sir, got a job here, seemily.


Darlington attempted to draw Miss Atkins aside.
\"What is it, madam ? " he asked. " Speak low,
pray."


\"What is it ?" she replied in a loud voice.
"This morning my poor brother was found dead,
murdered in his room."


Darlington had for a moment one of those
senseless suspicions which sometimes seize the most
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 157 -->
reasonable and unsuspecting of men: he recoiled
from Maddalena.


But she did not observe it. " Oh, God !" she
cried; " mio padre ! la vendetta !" and she sank
upon her knees.


\"It is too late to pray for mercy now," said Miss
Atkins.


\"Hush !" said Darlington, also in Italian; " not a
word to any one, as you value your father's
fife."
<!-- Leaf 166 -->
  
  CHAPTER IV.


Lorini took a cottage at Lichtenthal. His
faithful Antonio refused to leave him, or to let him
engage another servant.


After some trouble he found the manuscript of
the libretto which he had bought from Vivaldi. It
was entitled The Daughter of the Donati. The
subject, which is celebrated in Florentine history, and
to which Dante has alluded in his great poem, shall
be briefly described.


The date is A.D. 1215. Messer Mazzingo de
Mazzinghi is giving a corta bandita or revel, at his
villa near Campi. His guests are Florentines of
rank, and are being amused by minstrels, dancers
and improvisatori. In the course of the banquet
the family jester offends one of the nobles. There
is a quarrel, swords are drawn, and Buondelmonte
di Buondemonti wounds Oddo di Fifanti. A kind
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 159 -->
of court of honour is held, and it is arranged that
Buondelmonte shall marry Oddo's niece.


In the second act Aldruda dei Donati has sent
privately for Buondelmonte. She reproaches him
for cowardice in consenting to marry a woman whom
he does not love. She draws a curtain and shows

him her daughter asleep on a couch. While he
gazes, enraptured, at her beauty, her lips open; she
breathes his name; and still sleeping, sings a
confession of her love for him. She wakes, and in a
charming scene he makes her his betrothed.


In the third act the Buondemonti and the Fifanti,
with their retainers and a crowd of spectators, are
assembled in the no longer existing church of Santa
Maria Sopia Porta. In those days the marriage
ceremony was simple enough; the bridegroom placed
a ring on the finger of his bride. To the sound of
religious music Buondelmonte enters the church.
He haughtily passes the Fifanti and places his
ringon the finger of Aldruda's daughter. The priests
intervene to prevent bloodshed beneath the holy
roof; but a chorus of rage and revenge mingles with
the nuptial hymn.  
  
  
  In the fourth act, as the chronicles relate,
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 160 -->
Buondelmonte, mounted on a milk-white palfrey, and
dressed in a white mantle, with the bridal wreath
on his head, is riding through the streets of
Florence. As he passes by the castle of the lady
whom he has outraged, her relatives rush out, drag
him off his horse, and put him to death. A woman's
face appears at a window above, and they show her
their blood-stained swords.


His corpse is placed on a bier, with his head
resting on the lap of his widowed bride. While
she chants a dirge, and kisses his pale cheeks,
feaiful cries, the clash of arms, and the flaming sky
announce that the wars of the Guelphs and
Ghibellines have begun.


In writing this libretto, Vivaldi had studied
Metastasio and Scribe; the one for his style, the
other for plot and situation. He had combined the
harmonious cadence of Italian poetry with the logical
symmetry of the great French drama. Lorini
learnt the book by heart, and made it the constant
companion of his brain.


Henri Beyle has said, " II faut avoir senti le feu
devorant des passions pour exceller dans les beaux
<!-- Leaf 169, Page: 161 -->
arts." Lorini, when he took his pen into his hand,
was astonished by his own power. He did not
recognise himself. His imagination, which had once
crawled, which had laid so long in a chrysalis state,
now came forth a new creature, decked with radiant
colours, and endowed with wings.


Besides this, he had since leaving Florence made
a vast stride in the knowledge of his art. The old
connoisseur, whom he had met at the Craven,
had rightly prophesied, " Don Giovanni had been for
him a revelation." Having learnt the grandeur of
German harmony, he burned to possess its secrets.
He bought the scores of Sebastian Bach, Gliick,
Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Mozart, and studied
them day and night. He read their lives, and found
that most of them had been men of deep and
extensive reading. He took up Goethe and Schiller.
These rewarded him with ideas, and led him on to
Shakespeare, Milton, and Byron; to Rousseau,
Chateaubriand, and George Sand; and lastly to the
literature of his own country, of which he knew so
little, to Dante, Petrarch, Alfieri. This industry
brought him in speedy and abundant fruit. The
formative faculty is not able to raise up amasterVOL. II. X
<!-- Leaf 170, Page: 162 -->
piece of itself; the artist must dig up clay that his
conception may have a form. The brain to produce
much should devour much; to create in one art it
should feed upon all others.


By studying carefully the two great schools of
music, Lorini discovered the defects of each. The
German music has too many notes, as the German
literature has too many words. It is deep, but
troubled; a sun obscured by its own fog. It is also
deficient in melody; appeals more to the brain than
to the feelings; is in fact rather a science than an art.


The Italian music is vapid and shallow; the
instrumentation weak, the chorus only made use of
to permit the principal singer to repose. At the
theatres in Italy, tke audience meet to converse, and
only hush into silence when their favourite airs are
sung.


Lorini conceived the daring project of combining
within one opera the merits of the two schools.
He would be a German when he wrote for the
orchestra: an Italian when he wrote for the voice.
He would import harmony into Florence; he would
create a musical revolution; he would convert his
countrymen as he himself had been.
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 163 -->

Intoxicated with this idea, he laboured hard,
receiving fresh incentives as from time to time he
opened up new veins of thought. He
lived'frugally, walked several hours during every day, and
enjoyed excellent health.


At first he had thought a great deal of Maddalena
Her letters had touched him to the heart; he had
read them over many times, and it had pained him
when he thought how much she must have suffered.
But mingled with this feeling was one of
bitterness and contempt against her for having married
the man whom she had so often declared to him
that she abhorred. What could have been her
reason ? What could have made her abandon the
career in which she was making her fortune and her
fame ? Perhaps she had been actuated by a sordid
motive in making herself a singer; perhaps, like so
many other women who embrace the arts, she had
done so to gain notoriety and make a marriage of
ambition. Or, perhaps, she had married this man
in order to annoy him. It is commonly supposed
that women do this kind of thing. It is one of
the superstitions of society. Lorini's vanity made
him accept this solution of the enigma as the  
  
  
  ii 2
<!-- Leaf 172, Page: 164 -->
most reasonable. " Poor girl ! " thought he, " and
could you suppose that it would give me any pain
except from seeing that you could sink so low ?"


But soon consumed by his work, by the tyranny
of his ideas, he no longer turned his eyes upon the
past. As Jenoure had once predicted, he forgot that
there were women in the world. Art had become
his mistress, and he enjoyed with her the raptures
of a honeymoon : in which each embrace is a
discovery, and when not a cloud is in the sky.


One day that he was in Baden, where he had gone
to get books at Marx's library, he heard his name
pronounced. He looked round, and with some
difficulty recognised Restoni. The old man was horribly
changed. His cheeks were of a dull white,
corpselike colour, flabby and puffed out; his teeth were
decayed; his eyes bloodshot. He was in rags, and
compelled to support himself as he walked with a
stick.


Lorini took pity on the poor wretch, and ordering
a carriage, drove him home. Restoni recounted by
the way how his daughter's husband had given him
a hundred pounds to take him back to Italy, and
<!-- Leaf 173, Page: 165 -->
declared that he would not let him have another
farthing; how he had come to Baden, staked this
money at roulette, and lost. He had received his
fare to England from the bank, and had entrusted
it to a friend to stake for him. That had gone too.
He had written several letters to his daughter,
telling her that he was imprisoned in Baden, and that
he had not a farthing in the world. He had
received no answer from her. He had subsisted during
the last month he knew not how. He slept on a
bench. He went into the woods to find berries to
eat. Sometimes people put money in his hands, but
a Restoni could not beg. The poor creature's senses
appeared to be almost gone.


Neither Lorini nor his servant recognised the
disease of drunkenness in his face, and it was some
time before their suspicions were aroused. It was
evident that he was very ill, but he refused with energy
to see a doctor, fearing that from him they would
learn the truth, and knowing how the Italians detest
debauchery. "All that he wanted," he said, "was
food and rest." So they put him into a spare room,
and Antonio shared with him his meals. Sometimes
he tried to make himself useful in the house, but
<!-- Leaf 174, Page: 166 -->
  
  Antonio found that he could do better without him—

his hands trembled as if he had the palsy.


Once only Lorini began to reproach him gently
with having plotted against Maddalena and himself.
But Restoni denied everything- in a loud and
querulous voice, declaring that if his generous benefactor
believed in such a calumny he would relieve him of
his presence at once; he would go to the woods
and die. Whenever afterwards Lorini seemeddisposed to allude to the past, Restoni looked at him
with the eyes of a cat under an upraised arm. So
he said no more. But Restoni, who now hated his
daughter and her husband as he had once hated the
Marchese, resumed his old habit of fabrication, and
contrived to invent a very plausible tale.


\"Julie," he said, " was certainly sent into
Maddalena's service by the Baroness Sackowsky. It
was she who intercepted all the letters. I
myself had not anything to do with that; I was told
of it afterwards when the mischief was done. Then
this man Atkins proposed for Maddalena's hand,
and I refused. In the first place, Signor Marchese,
the man was a bourgeois; I did not choose that
my daughter should marry below her rank." Here
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 167 -->
Eugenio smiled, and Restoni, looking for a moment
discomfited, said, "I have never told you that I
am descended from one of the highest families in
Florence. My father was a prince; my mother was
privately married to him, but "  
  
  
  " I understand," said Lorini; " but continue."


\"I had also another reason for refusing this man,"
said Restoni. " I do not wish to deceive you, Signor
Marchese; I do not wish to pretend that I am a
thoroughly disinterested man. My daughter was
earning a large salary, which she left at my disposal.
Engagements were offered to her for Paris, Vienna,
and St. Petersburg. My enemies may perhaps have
told you that I helped to bring about that marriage.
But surely, Signor Marchese, you must see that it
could not have been to my interest to do so. They
may have told you that I was intimate with this
Signor Atkins. It is true that I had feelings of
friendship for the man; I cherished that viper in my
bosom. I heaped benefits upon him; I gave him all
except my daughter. I said to him, ' Signor Atkins,
in the first place, I do not wish my daughter to
many at all; I wish her to remain an artist; and, in
the second place, if she does marry, it must be with
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 168 -->
one of her own countrymen and of her own rank.' I
did not tell him that my birth was illegitimate, you
see," added Restoni, with an askant look. " I said
to him, moreover, ' there is the Signor Marchese dei
Lorini. He is our benefactor : he used once to have
an affection for my girl. Unhappily, we have
quarrelled; but I trust that we shall yet be reconciled
some day, I cannot think of marrying my daughter
without speaking first to him. I do not suppose that
he has ever intended to do her the honour of offering
her his hand; but 


\"But I wrote to you, offering to marry
Maddalena," said Lorini.


\"Ah, cursed Julie!" cried Restoni, clenching his
hands; " then you intercepted that letter too. Ah !
Signor Marchese —[ah, Eugenio! permit me so
to call you—what misery that letter would have
saved me from! Ay, and what shame from
my daughter," he added, turning up his eyes.
\"Well, well," he sighed, " let me end this sad
story now that I have begun. Atkins bribed Julie,
who had great influence over Maddalena. Ah ! what
a monster that girl was ! She wished to make her
mistress dislike her profession: so she invented
<!-- Leaf 177, Page: 169 -->
scandals, and spread them about, and then repeated
them to Maddalena. She said everything that she
could to discourage her with her art, and sent people
into the gallery to hiss. At the end of the season I
spoke to Maddalena about her engagements. She
had managers writing to her every day, and receiving
from her only evasive replies.


"' Oh ! I know not what to do,' she said. ' I am
sick of the stage. I would rather marry Mr. Atkins
and settle down for life.'  
  
  
  " 'And Eugenio V said I.


{empty}".She shrugged her shoulders. ' He has not
condescended to answer my letters,' she said.


"' But stdl,' said I, ' he is our benefactor, and I do
not think that 'j


"' Our benefactor !' said she, ' Pooh ! I have to
thank my voice, not him. The manager of the
Pergola would have done as much.'


"' Well, Maddalena,' said I, ' I will not argue the
matter with you; but as for marrying this bourgeois,
understand me plainly, I will never allow it.'


\"Well, Signor Marchese, the season had only just
concluded when the Signor Atkins gave an evening
party. He took my daughter aside into the
<!-- Leaf 178, Page: 170 -->
conservatory, and I observed them whispering together.
The next morning Maddalena made an excuse for
going out by herself directly after breakfast, and I
received a letter from her by the mid-day post. She
had just been married to Atkins, and they left
London for the Continent that day.


\"As you may imagine, Signor Marchese, I was not
much pleased with this intelligence; and I was forced
to borrow money to keep me till they returned from
their honeymoon abroad. Then I went down to
their house in the country, and first of all Maddalena
told me why she had married this man."  
  
  
  " And why had she ? " asked Eugenio.  
  
  
  Restoni shook his head.


\"Do not ask me that, Signor Marchese," he said,
and he resolutely refused to reply. Then he went
on:—


\"She took me into her husband, whose face was
full of malicious triumph. ' Well, Restoni,' he said,
' I suppose you have come down here to get some
money out of me ?'


"' I am without money, Signor Atkins,' said I;
' my daughter has always supported me, at least of
late.'
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 171 -->

\"' That is the fashion in Italy, I suppose,' said he,
with a sneer, ' for the young birds to feed the old.'


"' Signor Atkins,' said I, ' I have been
unfortunate '


"' Oh, I know all about that,' said he; ' you have
been a gambler. My wife has told me everything.
Now, you need not think that we intend to pander
to your vices. You managed to live somehow before
your daughter went on the stage, and you will be
able to live better now, for she will be off your hands.
Here is a hundred pounds to take you out there and
give you a start.'


"I attempted to remonstrate; but he said, '
Restoni, when I asked you for your daughter's hand, I
offered to settle a handsome sum on you for life.
You would not have that. Well, now you must have
what you can get.'


\"I appealed to Maddalena, but she only shrugged
her shoulders, and said, ' It is not my business, I am
my husband's property.' And what do you think,
Signor Marchese ? I knelt before that girl, whom I
shall never see again. I prayed her to bless me
before I went, and she refused. I took the money  
  
  
  •and the rest you know."
<!-- Leaf 180, Page: 172 -->

Restoni was a thorough master of the art of lying.
He simulated to perfection the candid look, and the
clear, unfaltering voice of truth. No wonder, indeed,
that he deceived others; frequently, for the moment,
he deceived himself. As the actor's cheeks
sometimes flush with real rage, and as his eyes shed real
tears, so Restoni, carried away by a vivid
imagination, almost persuaded himself that these were real
wrongs that he had suffered. And when he spoke
of her refusal to bless him, which, as the reader
knows, was founded upon fact, he burst into a wail
of genuine and child-like grief.


Lorini, who had begun to listen with incredulity,
and only in order to be amused, felt sure that he
had been in some way badly treated. They might have
given him more money than this miserable hundred
pounds; he might have exaggerated their coldness
and barbarity; but still here was a living fact before
his eyes. Here was the miserable creature, diseased,
perhaps dying, with no food in his body, and no
clothes upon his back. Lorini promised him a home
as long as he had one to give him. He did not
judge a ruined gambler so harshly as he would have
done a twelvemonth before. He had learnt from
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 173 -->
himself how difficult it is to struggle with a passion.
Perhaps there would be more charity if there were
less rigid virtue in the world. It now seemed to
Lorini almost natural that Restoni should have spent
at the Tombola the money which had been given
him to buy his daughter food. He could now
understand that men do not commit such crimes in cold
blood, but are driven to them by an impulse which
they are unable to resist.


Eugenio had no cause to feel rancour against
Restoni. He had never been so happy in his life
as he was now—his time equally divided between
toil and thought. He dwelt in an artist's paradise,
encircled by houris whom he himself created. He
remembered that it was Restoni who had helped to
cast him out of the sunshine in which he had been
basking his life away.


Restoni informed him that he suffered in the chest,
and had found that the waters did him good. He
was strong enough, he said, to walk to Baden if
the Marchese would pay for his carriage back. So
he walked to Baden every day, drank several glasses
of raw cognac, swallowed some lozenges to
<!-- Leaf 182, Page: 174 -->
disguise the smell, and tottered back on foot, saying
always that he had made the driver put him down
at a little distance off. But one day he took too
much, forgot his lozenges, and came home manifestly
drunk.


He complained bitterly when Lorini refused to
trust him again with money. He had arrived at
that stage when drink becomes a necessity; when
the sot is warned by instinct to beware of
abstinence; for it is thus that delirium tremens is
almost always produced. It is the stimulant which
destroys, the stimulant which saves.


Restoni still kept up the farce of drinking the
waters, and made a daily pilgrimage to Baden.
Presently Antonio, who kept the accounts, observed
that there was a perpetual deficit. This puzzled
and annoyed him : he racked his brain to recollect
if he could have purchased something which he had
forgotten to put down. Eveiy evening he took his
little book and added up the inexorable figures again
and again.


One night he was aroused by a phantom which
bore the semblance of Restoni. It glided softly to
the chair on which his clothes were hung, extracted
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 175 -->
some money from the pockets, and disappeared.
Antonio took a brick out of the floor when Restoni
was absent, and hid his money under it. He
noticed that Restoni watched him for some days
afterwards, but took care that he should discover
nothing.


But Restoni still went to Baden, and one night
he came home drunk again. At the same time
Antonio missed some silver forks and spoons, and
Lorini a copy of Dante, illustrated with rare
engravings. They went up to his room. It was filled with
a disagreeable smell. They listened to his heavy
stertorous breathing. He was fast asleep. Antonio
uttered an exclamation of fright, and Lorini
perceived that his breath was luminous—a phenomenon
owing to the noxious gases which had been
generated within him by the alcohol. They lighted a
candle, and Antonio, having rummaged in his pockets,
found a pawnbroker's duplicate for the missing
articles. They redeemed it and said nothing, but
they took care for the future to lock up everything
that was of value.


Restoni knew that he had been detected, but
showed no signs of shame. He conversed affably
<!-- Leaf 184, Page: 176 -->
with Antonio, and even bantered him when he saw
him putting away the plate which he had once
purloined. He now appeared to be rapidly losing the
use of his faculties. His utterance was habitually
thick and inarticulate. He talked fast, but only
half-pronounced his words. His mendacity had
become monstrous; he told lies incessantly without
aim or purpose, often to his own disadvantage, and
contradicted himself at eveiy moment. He hung
continually about Lorini, fawning on him; and
constantly assuring him of his gratitude and love.
His face had now been rendered hideous; his
manners, which had once been fascinating, had
become ludicrous—the grimaces of gesture. Lorini
bore with him patiently for a long time, but he had
now become buried in his work; he was nervous
and excitable, impatient of interruption; he was
disgusted by Restoni's appearance, and by his
conversation; he found that this 'apparition disturbed his
conceptions, and bade Antonio keep it out of his
sight. Restoni wept when he was forbidden to go
to his master, as he now called him; but was soon
consoled when Antonio asked him some questions
about his noble ancestors, or about the villa which
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 177 -->
he had possessed before his daughter's education
swallowed up all his means.


But still he went out every morning- and came
home late at night. He did not go to Baden now.
When questioned by Antonio, he said, "No, my
friend, I have given up the waters. I fear that
nothing will do me good on this side of the tomb."


\"Where do you go then all day long ?" asked
Antonio repeatedly, and each time that he asked the
question, the fertile Restoni gave a different reply.
Once he said that he loved to spend his days in
the forest, admiring the scenery; the effect of the
snow upon the trees was so very charming. Another
time he said that a friend of his at Baden was
about to contract with the Grand Duke for a fall
of timber; and as he (Restoni) had once owned a
pine forest or two in the Apennines, he had been
asked to give an opinion on the trees. On another
occasion, having exacted from Antonio a promise
of secrecy, he had whispered to him his conviction
that there was gold in the mountains above Baden,
and that it was washed down into the valley by the
winter torrents. And once he had said, in a solemn
voice, " Antonio, my friend, you ask me why I  
  
  
  VOL. II. "
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 178 -->
wander all day long among the mountains and the
woods. Shall I tell you what I do ? I reflect upon
the uncertainty of human happiness, and I prepare
myself for immortality."


But as Restoni always smelt very strong of
brandy when he returned from these excursions,
Antonio's curiosity became uncontrollable. One
morning he followed Restoni for at least two miles
through the forest. At length he stopped, and
having looked cautiously round him, pulled up some
moss and leaves, drew out a bottle, which he held
up to the light, and apostrophized in the most
affectionate" terms; then, giving a yell of delight, knocked
off the head against a branch, emptied it at a
draught, and staggered past the concealed Antonio,
his lips slimy, his eyes rolling and convulsed. The
next day he went in a totally different direction. It
was evident that he had a store of brandy bottles
concealed in different places. " But where could it
all have come from ?" said Antonio.


In a few days the mystery was explained. Lorini
received a bill from a wine-shop in Baden. On
inquiry he found that Restoni, representing himself
to be his servant, had ordered it in his name and
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 179 -->
had taken it away himself. They paid the bill, and
cautioned all the tradesmen in the town.


In a short time, Antonio observed that Restoni
became restless and uneasy. He still went out as
usual, but it was probable that his stock was
becoming exhausted. Antonio heard that he had been to
the wine-shop to give another order, and that, failing
there, he had made the round [of all the taverns and
hotels.


One evening, as they were sitting together by the
kitchen fire, Restoni, who" for some time had been
fidgeting about, got up and said :


\"The Marchese must feel very dull there
upstairs all by himself. I will go and converse with
him."


\"No, stop where you are; he does not want to be
conversed with. He is busy."  
  
  
  " What is he doing then ? "


\"What is he doing ? Why, have not I told you a
dozen times that he is writing an opera ? "


\"Antonio, caro mio," said Restoni, in a caressing
voice. " Why do we live in this miserable little
cottage ? Why do we not live, as beseems our rank,
in a villa, or a chateau ?"  
  
  
  n 2
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 180 -->

\"Bah ! it is a caprice: my master Lhas taken a
fancy to seclusion."


\"Yes; but one need not live in a hovel for that,
you know. One can seclude oneself excellently in a
palace."


\"Yes; but you see the Marchese is an artist as
well as a noble, and of course has his whims, and
this is one."


Restoni gave a sly look. " He is not too rich now,
the Marchese."


"Who told you that?" said Antonio, with a
derisive laugh.


\"He did," replied Restoni. " My noble benefactor
told me so himself. ' My dear Jacopo,' he said (that
was when I first came here), ' my own parents are
dead, but I shall always regard you as my father.
I am no longer the Marchese dei Lorini; I am
Eugenio the artist. I am poor now, but while I have
a crust to eat, I will share it with you.' I was
touched to the heart when he said this," continued
Restoni, wiping his eyes, "and I said to him,
'Signor Marchese, I will not ask you by what
misfortunes you have been impoverished. I know
from my own experience what agony it is to re-open
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 181 -->
ancient wounds; but I accept from you the refuge
and the alms which, offered by a bourgeois, I would
reject with scorn.' Oh, Antonio, is it not a touching
spectacle, this, of two ruined nobles under a cotter's
roof,—both proud, both beggared : the one labouring
as an artist, the other conversing familiarly with a
servant, and even consenting to drink with him a

bottle of wine?"  
  
  
  " Your family's the older of the two, is it not ? "

asked Antonio, professing to ignore this delicate hint.

\"My father was the Duke di i" said

Restoni, proudly. " We trace our pedigree with ease
to the time of the Roman Republic. Then I do
not mind confessing to you, that it becomes a little

obscure."  
  
  
  " Then you are a Roman after all. But I thought

you said your father was the Prince... a.  
  
  
  " Antonio," said Restoni, sternly, " you, with the

base and sordid ideas of a peasant, cannot
understand my feelings. My noble father has been
prevented from publicly recognising me by domestic
and political causes. I, who know that not only his
peace of mind, but his life depends upon my secrecy,
am therefore justified in using a little equivocation
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 182 -->
upon this subject. When, therefore, at an early
period of our friendship, I told you that my father  
  
  
  was the Prince... a, I am not ashamed to say

that I deceived you. But now, after having learnt to
place full confidence in you, dear Antonio, Iconfessthat my father was the—wasthe
\"The Marchese... o," replied Antonio,

slyly
\"Yes, the Marchese... o," replied Restoni, after

a little hesitation, for he had forgotten the name
which he had mentioned first. " As you justly
remarked, we are an older family than the Lorini.
Between ourselves you know, Antonio, his title is
mere tinsel,—an Austrian creation; and as for his
ancestors, what were they, after all, but like the
other Florentines,—like the Medici themselves,—
wretched wool-weavers, and money-lenders, and
brokers, Atkinses of the middle ages. Antonio,
the best blood of Sicily runs in my veins. On my

escutcheon" Who was your mother ? " said Antonio,


Antonio gave a lofty smile. " That is a state
secret," he said, " and I once swore it should never
cross my lips."
<!-- Leaf 191, Page: 183 -->

\"But you cannot refuse anything to your friend
Antonio."


Restoni shook his head. " It is a long story, and
I cannot talk without refreshment. Let us have

a bottle of wine over it."


"It is only the wine of the country," said
Antonio.


\"Well, I don't mind a glass of brandy," said
Restoni, with an expression of indifference.


Antonio shook his head, went out of the room
into a parlour, which opened out of the kitchen.
He was stealthily followed by Restoni, who saw him
open a buffet, which seemed to be full of bottles, and
take out one on which was written in gilt letters on
a red label Affenthaler.


\"Now," said Antonio, after they had drunk some
glasses, " let us have this grand secret."  
  
  
  " What secret ?"  
  
  
  " Why, your mother's name."


\"My mother's name," said Restoni, absently; then
recalling his idea by a prodigious effort, "Ah, yes,
my mother's name! Well, that, my friend, will
explain everything; how I have been neglected;
how I have been denied; how I have been
<!-- Leaf 192, Page: 184 -->
forbidden to approach my birth-place; how I have
been plundered of parental love. Antonio, swear to
me that you will never utter again what I tell you
now; the life of a man, the honour of a woman, the
safety of a kingdom, depend upon j*our silence. Hist!
my father was the Marchese di o, and my
mother was—the Queen !"


This was too much for Antonio, who was old
enough to recollect Restoni's mother giving him the
breast, while she stood on the Lung' Arno, and sold
melons by the slice. He made an excuse for leaving
the room, let out his laughter, and came back to
find Restoni with the bottle raised to his lips.


Our friend Jacopo might be easily turned from
an idea, but he always returned to it with a
pertinacity which nothing could resist.


\"But tell me, Antonio," he said, " how is it that
our Eugenio is so poor ? "  
  
  
  " He lent money to a frieird," said Antonio, curtly.


\"Ah, poverino ! " sighed Restoni. " Well know I
what that means. And now he is writing an opera.
What will be the good of that ?"


\"Why, he will sell it to a manager of course, and
make himself rich again."
<!-- Leaf 193, Page: 185 -->

\"But why should he shut himself up so ? That
false child of mine—Maddalena—she learnt her art

without going into a cell like a hermit."


\"Corpo di Bacco ! what a man ! " cried Antonio.
\"Can you not see the difference between making
things and selling them ? For one is required
solitude and abstraction, for the other a voice, that is
all. That is what my master told me himself; and
he composes and sings too."


Restoni shook his head. " Ah, my poor Antonio,"
he said, with a smile of pity, " how blind you are !
Do you not see that Eugenio " here Restoni
pointed to the bottle.


\"What!" cried Antonio, bursting into a scream
of laughter.


"I do not blame him," said Restoni, gravely.
\"He has suffered misfortune, and he overtaxes his
brain. But it is always a sad thing when a young
man attempts to drown sorrow or to stimulate his
imagination with ardent spirits."  
  
  
  " Why, he is the most temperate man alive."


"Then what means that buffet?" said Restoni,
sternly. " What means that brandy-bottle which
you take up-stairs to him every day ?"
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 186 -->

\"Bah ! he takes a* gloria after dinner like most
people; that is all he ever drinks."


"In fact," said Restoni, smacking his lips, "a
cognac with a coffee is not a bad thing. Could you
not make me a cup of coffee, Antonio ?"  
  
  
  " No, not now; it is time to go to bed,


\"Well, then, the cognac without the coffee,"
suggested Jacopo, humbly.  
  
  
  " Come," said Antonio, rising.


\"No, no," said Restoni, trembling, " not yet. I
hate to go to bed; I never get to sleep, and
sometimes I see nasty things. Let us talk a little about
this opera. When will it be finished?"


\"Perhaps in half a year. Ah ! there is the piano.
Hush ! This is the dreaming scene. Is it not sweet
music, Restoni?"


\"Yes, yes," he said, " it is sweet and soothing as—
as the Kirschwasser of the Black Forest. I could
soon sleep if I heard that every night."


\"Now the soprano begins to sing. When I hear
this air it always makes the tears come into my eyes."


\"So did the Kirschwasser with me at first,"
muttered Restoni, " it was so very strong."  
  
  
  When the music had finished, Antonio struck the
<!-- Leaf 195, Page: 187 -->
table with his hand. " Midler and Oppen at Vienna
would give a thousand thalers for that air alone," he
cried.


Restoni's eyes gleamed. Then, yawning, he took
his rushlight and, bidding Antonio " Good-night,"
went up to bed.


The next day Lorini, having returned from his
morning's walk, missed his manuscripts from the
piano, on which he usually laid them. He called
Antonio. They hunted for them everywhere, but in
vain. It was clear that they could not have been
mislaid—the room was so small. They looked at
each other with anxious eyes. Then Antonio cried
with a curse, " It is Restoni! Like a fool I told him
last night that Midler and Oppen at Vienna would
pay a thousand thalers for your duet."


Lorini became as white as a sheet, staggered, and
almost fell. For some moments he could not speak.
He had felt, as he said afterwards, something like a
flame of fire pass through his brain.


\"0 my God, my God !" he murmured, " this is too
much ! He has robbed me of my thoughts — of
precious thoughts which I have written down, but
few of which I can recall. Besides, they will be
<!-- Leaf 196, Page: 188 -->
published—my duet will go through Europe like
wildfire : it is the gem of my opera; it is the best effort
of my brain. Oh, Antonio, advise me, help me !
What is to be done ?"


\"Everything," said Antonio, briskly. " We shall
find Restoni at Vienna, if we do not overtake him
before he gets to the Baden station. How on earth
will he get the money to pay his fare ? But, come,
Signor, we have not a minute to lose."


But they had already lost a minute, and arrived
at the station as the express was leaving it. They
found that a man answering to their description of
Restoni had taken a ticket to Vienna. They were
compelled to wait the whole day at Baden, and
started by the night train. During the journey
Lorini did not sleep for a moment; nor did Antonio,
who watched his master with anxiety. The poor
man (whose agonies can be understood only by a
painter, a writer, or a composer,) crouched in a
corner of the carriage with his head upon his breast,
sometimes bursting into fits of maniacal wrath. He
anticipated in his mind every misfortune that could
possibly arrive. Restoni would get drunk and lose
the music on the way. He would have sold it to the
<!-- Leaf 197, Page: 189 -->
publishers, and they would pretend that they had
not received it, or would make copies of the airs
and publish them before the rest of the opera was
completed. It was daybreak when they arrived at
Vienna. Antonio wished him to go to a hotel and
take some hours of sleep, while he stood on guard
before the pubhsher's shop. But Lorini would not
do this. He said that it would be • impossible for
him to sleep, and that he should be better in the
open air. So he remained in the street, sometimes
pacing slowly and moodily along, sometimes walking
at a terrific pace. At length the shop shutters began
to be taken down, and then they were obliged to
wait two hours before one of the partners arrived.


When they were introduced into his room, Lorini
at first could not recollect a word of French. He

uttered some confused phrases in Italian, and then
cried, in a savage voice, " Monsieur, ma musique!
rendez-moi ma musique !"


Antonio explained to the publisher that some
music manuscripts belonging to his master had been
stolen by a person named Restoni, whom they had
traced to this shop.  
  
  
  The publisher, giving an anxious glance at
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 190 -->
Lorini, left the room and returned with a packet
which he opened. Lorini gave a cry of delight, tore
the papers from his hand, and rapidly turned them
over, saw that they were all there, and, giving a low
gasp, fainted away.


The publisher informed them afterwards that the
packet had been brought to him the night before by
an old man, decently dressed. He had said that it
contained the fragments of an opera, composed by
his son Eugenio Restoni, who, unhappily, had taken
to hard drinking and had died at the premature age
of twenty-one. He had wept in relating this
circumstance; the packet had been taken, and an answer
had. been promised him in the course of the forenoon.


\"You had not even opened it, then ?" said
Antonio.


"Not till this moment," replied the publisher,
who was somewhat surprised to notice a triumphant
glance pass from the servant to the master, and the
latter's reassured air.


In an hour's time Restoni made his appearance.
He was dressed in some old clothes belonging to
Lorini, and, as they afterwards found out, he had
pawned some new ones to obtain the money for his
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 191 -->
journey. Eugenio was so happy at regaining his
manuscripts that he did not think of reproaching
Restoni; but, after the former had gone to bed,
Antonio played a little comedy in which a sabred
official was introduced, and which frightened the
poor wretch almost to death.


Antonio saw that his master's close application to
work had already affected his brain; he persuaded
him to remain some days at Vienna. He did so;
went to the theatre, studied the orchestra, and
picked up some valuable hints from instrumentalists,
whom he consulted about his opera. This change of
life also freshened his mind, and he returned to his
solitude at Lichtenthal more enthusiastic even than
before.


He had a long conversation with Antonio about
Restoni.


"Let us put him into an asylum," said
Antonio.


Lorini shrugged his shoulders. " It would be
dangerous to try that," said he; " he might persuade the
doctors that we were mad.^That man would talk
over anybody who did not know him."  
  
  
  " In fact, he has the tongue of the old serpent,"
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 192 -->
said Antonio. "Well, let us put him with a
family."


\"No," replied Lorini, nobly, " he would rob them
as he has robbed us, and they would send him to
prison. He is not a madman, and he is not a thief.
He is a drunkard. In all countries there ought to
be an asylum for these poor imbeciles, but as there
is not "


\"Then we will bear with him," said Antonio. " I
will buy an iron box for your music, so that when he
sets the house on fire, as he will some day, your
opera shall not be destroyed. But he shall have no
more drink—curse him."


Antonio kept his word. He set the police upon
him; they warned the pawnbroker to take nothing
more from him. Restoni succeeded in selling the
gridiron Avhich the former refused to a peasant of the
Black Forest, who was passing along the road^ But the
police, taunted by Antonio for this oversight on
thenpart, dogged poor Restoni as soon as he set his foot
in town; they detected him in false rags begging at
the steps of the Trink-halle, and drove him off; and
even when by some miraculous expedient he had
earned a few kreutzers, and was about to enter a
<!-- Leaf 201, Page: 193 -->
wine-shop, he would feel a hand tap him on the
shoulder, and a menacing voice would forbid him
to go in.


The result of this will already have been foreseen
by those who know anything of medicine. Restoni
showed signs of uneasiness; he became restless; he
wandered vaguely hither and thither, like a dog which
is going mad. He asked permission of Antonio to let
him sleep on the floor of his room, saying that he
was afraid of being alone. Antonio consented, but
the man's groans and exclamations during the night
prevented him from sleeping. At last one night
Lorini was awoke by a knock at his door, and by
the terrified voice of his servant, which implored him
to come immediately to Restoni. He went, and
found him raving. Tossing about on the bed, with
his wild and haggard eyes fixed always on one
corner of the room, he cursed Atkins, Julie, and
Maddalena, whom he saw standing there like
phantoms, deriding him. He complained of the rats
which kept running over him, and of the black
things on the walls. He shrieked, bounded up, ran
to the window and tried to fling himself out. They
strapped him down upon Antonio's bed. Then he  
  
  
  VOL. II. 0
<!-- Leaf 202, Page: 194 -->
fancied that he saw the Devil, who was angling for
him with a silver hook. His face elongated itself
till it resembled that of a fish. Attempting to
raise himself, he snapped in the air, uttering savage
cries.


They sent for a physician from Baden, who gave
him opium. He told them that it was an attack of
delirium tremens, and that it had been caused by his
forced sobriety. " When he wakes up," he said, " he
will have recovered. We must place him on a
drinkdiet, which you will lessen gradually and with great
care, till at length it will be safe to deprive him
altogether of such stimulants."


When Restoni came to his senses, the delirium
was passed, but he appeared too weak to leave his
room. He drank the doses of brandy which were
given him with an eagerness terrible to see. When
they refused to give him more, he swore at them
in a feeble voice : he said that they were shutting
him up in a prison to amuse themselves with his
agony; that they gave him enough to tantalise him,
that was all.


Thus three days passed. On the third evening,
Antonio, as he was seated by the kitchen fire, saw
<!-- Leaf 203, Page: 195 -->
something white glide past the door. At the same
moment it flashed upon him that he had left the
buffet unlocked. He ran to the parlour, but it was
too late : Restoni sprang past him with a bottle in
each hand, rushed up to his own room and locked
himself in. Antonio shouted for his master; they
broke open the door, and discovered Restoni upon
the bed, one bottle lying empty on the floor, the
other between his hands.  
  
  
  " Go for the doctor, Antonio," cried Lorini.


Restoni shook his head, raised himself a little,
and muttered the word " dying." He. beckoned
Lorini to him, and after several efforts, whispered in
his ear,


\"She said—she said that she would marry him to
spite you."


Then a frightful sneer crossed his lips. He
stretched out his arms, and falling back expired with
his eyes fixed upon Lorini.

  CHAPTER V.


The corpse of Richard Atkins was stretched upon
the bed. By its side stood the rector, the parish
doctor, the butler, and a rustic policeman.


\"You say then, John," said the doctor, " that you
went to call your master as usual ? "  
  
  
  " Yes, sir; at half-past seven o'clock."


\"And you found him in his bath, dead, with his
face under the water—eh ?"  
  
  
  "Exactly, sir."  
  
  
  " Very good, then; you may go."


The doctor was a portly, red-faced man, with an
appearance half clerical, half sporting—a white
cravat, a black coat, and a red face above; below,
an abdomen of provincial dimensions, and a pair of
cord trousers fitting tightly to his legs. He took a
large pinch of snuff, and said :  
  
  
  "From the appearance of the bcdy, which I have
<!-- Leaf 205, Page: 197 -->
carefully examined, and from what our friend John
says, I feel myself justified in asserting that this is a
case—I may add, a clear and unquestionable case—
of asphyxia by submersion."


"Is it, really?" said the rector, in a plaintive
voice. " Dear, dear, what a lesson to us all!"


\"And what be that, then, sir ? " asked the
policeman, who considered it his duty to understand the
case.


\"In plain words," said the doctor, taking another
pinch of snuff, " poor Mr. Atkins has been drowned."


\"What, drowned in a bath!" cried the rector.
\"I never heard of such a thing."


\"Haw! haw ! haw !" laughed the policeman.
\"Well, that be a good 'un, however !"


\"My good sir," said the doctor, tapping his
snuffbox with an irritated finger, " I know perfectly well
what I'm talking about. I suppose you think a
man must fall into the Thames before he can be
drowned."


\"I must confess I do not think a common
hipbath is quite deep enough," said the rector, with a
knowing smile, which produced a fresh guffaw from
the policeman.
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 198 -->

\"Oh, you don't!" said the doctor. " Policeman,
pour a little water into that wash-hand basin—a
very little. There, that will do. Now, Mr. Parson,
that's not very deep, is it? but I'll undertake to
drown you in it, as dead as a door nail. Will you
try?"  
  
  
  The clergyman politely declined.


\"Haw ! haw ! haw!" laughed the policeman.
\"Parson's afeerd as I shall take 'ee up for't and get
'ee hanged may-be. Haw ! haw ! haw !"


The rector became suddenly grave. "My
brethren," said he, "this is no place for levity.
Remember, we are in the presence of the dead."


\"Ignorant people," said the doctor, testily, "
suppose that the whole body must be phmged under
waterto cause drowning; but if there is enough to cover
the mouth and nostrils for a sufficient time, death
must inevitably ensue."


\"Well now, the next question is, what caused his
death ?" said the clergyman.


\"Ah, there you want to know too much," said the
doctor. " Drowning seems a simple thing, but I
recollect when I was a student I couldn't get an)'
one to tell me how it causes death, and I couldn't
<!-- Leaf 207, Page: 199 -->
find it out in any book. Some said it was due to
the introduction of water into the air-passage;
others, to a collapsed state of the lungs; others, to
congestion of the cerebral vessels; others "


"I don't mean that," said the rector. "I mean,
what has caused the drowning. I cheerfully allow
that a man can be drowned in a bath, or a
washhand basin; but it can hardly be by accident, I
presume. You couldn't say that he got out of his
depth."


"Yes, now we be coming to the point," said the
policeman. " Martha Ann, she came down to me
and woke me out of my sleep, for I'd been on the
rounds all night, and she says to me, says she,
' There's been foul play up at the gret house, and
you're wanted,' she said, so up I gets, and here I
comes, and now what is ut ? "


The doctor tapped his box in an undecided
manner, and took a meditative pinch.


\"Having established asphyxia by submersion as
the proximate cause of death, I was about to
examine into the ultimate causes, when interrupted by
my reverend friend. Now, in my humble opinion,
there is only one which deserves a moment's
<!-- Leaf 208, Page: 200 -->
attention. I am forced, gentlemen, to state as my
belief, as my firm conviction, that Mr. Atkins was
drowned "


\"Whde under an epileptic fit," said a voice
behind him.


The doctor turned round. Two men had come in
unobserved. One of them was already gliding round
the room, glancing at everything, and stopping to
inspect minutely the window fastenings, and the
door which led into Maddalena's dressing-room.
The other, who had just spoken, presented his card
to the doctor, with a gracious bow.


\"Dr. Charles Darlington !" he said. " What! of
St. Bridget's?"  
  
  
  Darlington bowed.


\"I am sure, sir," said the doctor, looking a little
confused, " that I amTdelighted to have your most
valuable assistance. You think, then "


"I think then, as you do, sir," said Darlington,
looking at him with a little twinkle in his eyes,
"that the deceased was drowned while under
the influence of an epileptic seizure. Only
pray excuse my taking the words out of your
mouth."
<!-- Leaf 209, Page: 201 -->

\"Don't mention it, sir, don't mention it," said the
doctor, getting veiy red.


\"Then no personal violence," said the rector, " has
been the cause of "  
  
  
  " None whatever," replied Darlington.


\"What, ain't he be' murdered arter all ? " said the
policeman, in an injured tone.


\"And what reasons have you," said the rector,
with a suspicious look, " for supposing that it was
owing to epilepsy "


\"You observe these punctiform extravasations, as
they are called," said Darlington, pointing to some
small red spots on the temples of the body. " They
are caused by excessive congestion and consequent
rupture of small blood-vessels, which drowning by
violence would not produce. Then, here is the
tongue bitten—we could not have a better proof.
The foam has been washed away by the water in
the bath, but I dare say you will find there a
slight tinge of blood."


"I never knew that poor Mr. Atkins was
epileptic," said the clergyman, who, having made up his
mind that he had been murdered, felt disinclined to
change it.
<!-- Leaf 210, Page: 202 -->

"Possibly not," said Darlington, drily; "these
matters are usually kept secret in families. Well,
Simcox, what do you make out of it ?"


\"Nobody been in the room from outside, sir, and
as you see, there are no marks of violence on the
neck, as there would be if the face had been held
under water."


\"It is curious," said the rector, " that the butler
should not have said anything- about Mr. Atkins
being epileptic, is it not ? "


\"Damn him, yes ! " muttered the provincial doctor
to himself. " I should like to knock his teeth down
his throat."


Darlington spoke to the detective for a few
moments, in a whisper, and then rang the bell.  
  
  
  The butler came up.


\"Now, sir," said Simcox, " have the kindness to
look at me in the face. You know who I am,
don't you ? Well, then, you'd better be careful.
What did you do as soon as you found your master
in the bath ? "


\"I took him out and laid him on the bed, and
tried to revive him," said the butler.  
  
  
  " Very good, and what did you do next ?
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 203 -->

\"I went and told missis—Mr. Atkins's sister that
is—and then we went to Mrs. Atkins's room and
found "


\"There, we don't want to hear anything about
that. Who did you send for ?"  
  
  
  " Doctor and the policeman, sir."


"And what message did you send, if you
please ?"  
  
  
  I sent to say that Mr. Atkins_was dead, that was

all.


\"You sent and told me that your master had
been murdered, you infernal liar," cried the doctor.


\"Well, sir, I'm sure I thought that he had,"
whined the man.


\"Now then, just answer me one question, ' How
long has your master had fits ?' "


The wretch began to prevaricate, but quailed
beneath that terrible eye. " Ever since I have been
in his service," said he.


Simcox seized him by the collar, and dragged him
to the bed-side. " Look here," said he, pointing to
the bitten tongue," d'ye know what that means, eh ?
You've seen that before, haven't you ? What made
you send for me, with your cock-and-bull stories, and
<!-- Leaf 212, Page: 204 -->
trying to take in the doctor, eh ? Now then, I want
to see Miss Atkins."


As he said this, they heard a gasp from outside
the door, and the rustle of a dress retreating swiftly.


\"Case of conspiracy, sir," said the detective to
Darlington, drawing him aside. "Parties want to
proceed, d'ye think ? "


\"Oh, no," said Darlington, shaking his head;
\"besides, you see, nothing could be established."


\"No, sir, that's true. We've nipped it in the bud.
It would have ripened beautifully if we'd held off.
I should like to see the woman, though."


\"So you shall," said Darlington, " and make her
leave the house."


\"All right, sir. They must stop here till the
inquest is over, to give evidence, but they shall clear
out after that, the pair of them."


Darlington was now anxious to go to Maddalena,
who he knew to be suffering tortures, but on the
landing outside the door he was intercepted by the
doctor.


It had not been the first time that Darlington had
covered a colleague's ignorance, and the medical
etiquette on such occasions is to avoid allusion to
<!-- Leaf 213, Page: 205 -->
the subject. But this worthy provincial had the
bad taste to feel gratitude and to express it.


\"You saved me from making a fool of myself, Dr.
Darlington," said he, in a rough voice, "and I thank
ye for't. I should never have heard the last of it
down here. The country's not like London, worse
luck."


"WeU, it is only natural that four eyes should
be able to see more than two, you know," said
Darlington.


\"Ay, sir; it's very kind of you to put it in that
light, but your eyes saw in a moment what mine
hadn't seen in an hour."


\"Yes, and I will tell you why. The first time I
saw Mr. Atkins I suspected that he was an epileptic.
So I came into the room half prepared to find what
I did."


\"Well, of course you had a great advantage over
me so far. I never attended on him, nor ever saw
him, not to say close. But, ah ! we have no chance
with you Londoners. In a place like this a man
soon forgets the little he ever learnt. There's
nothing done here in a regular way, except a little
gout and rheumatism. Accidents, of course, one can
<!-- Leaf 214, Page: 206 -->
never depend upon, and what's the use of a case like
this once in five years ? There couldn't be a worse
county than this. Now, when I was a young man
practising in Smithfield, and taking in free patients,
it was a very different kettle of fish. My goodness ! "
said the doctor, voluptuously smacking his lips, " that
was a neighbourhood. Something like disease there
—and a nice variety of it too ! I was a fool ever to
leave it and come down in a place like this, where one
never gets a new book, nor sees a Lancet, nor gets any
one to talk to who knows more than oneself. I know
more about crops now than I do about anatomy."


\"Certainly," said Darlington, " there is no place
like London. We not only have every facility with
books and patients, we learn also so much from
social intercourse among ourselves. The
conversation of distinguished medical men is a vast and
instructive unwritten literature; there are many
whose minds are stored with the experience of a
life.-time, and who have scarcely written a line.
Besides, in London almost all the specialists of
England are collected. One has given his life-time
to diseases of the liver, another to those of the
heart, another to those of the brain. One learns in
<!-- Leaf 215, Page: 207 -->
a few minutes from such men as these what could
only have been discovered by years of patient
investigation, and by the comparison of a thousand
cases. But now you will excuse me, will you
not ? I must go and make my report to Mrs.
Atkins."


\"Cheer up, Maddalena!" he said, entering her
room; " your husband is dead, but he has not been
murdered."


\"Holy Virgin, I thank thee ! " she cried, sinking
on her knees.


After she had become more calm, she asked him
what was this epilepsy of which he had died. He
explained to her briefly the nature of this disease,
which in ancient times and among savages still is
ascribed to demoniac possession. He told her how
the attacks are often preceded by the warning aura,
which is supposed to feel like a current of air—the
breath of the approaching disease. He told her of
the fear which comes over the sufferer, of the
unearthly shriek which he sometimes utters, of the
savage convulsions into which he falls, and how
attack following attack, his face assumes a peculiar
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 208 -->
appearance, and his mind loses its faculties one by
one.


\"And why did you not tell me of this before ?
she asked.


\"You had troubles enough, my poor girl," he
replied, " and you could not have been of any use."


Miss Atkins and the butler left the house
immediately after the coroner's inquest. The next day
the family solicitor came down, accompanied by
another who represented the interests of the
aforesaid lady. A will was discovered locked up in a
box, of which Miss Atkins had never been able to
borrow the key. When the will was read everybody
(except the lawyer who had drawn it up) was
astounded. The deceased left the whole of his

property to Maddalena, excepting a hundred a-year
to his sister. It was thus he attempted to atone to
the one and to revenge himself upon the other.


The first step which Maddalena took was to seek
for her father. He was advertised for in all the
papers. A private inquiry was set on foot, but they
could only discover that he had sold his life annuity,
and had gone abroad. Maddalena hoped that she
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 209 -->
might find him at Florence, and made arrangements
for going there. But something prompted her to
look through her husband's papers before she left
the house.


All his letters were tied up in separate bundles
and labelled. She passed over packet after packet
on matters relating to business. She opened one,
on which was written in a round, firm hand, " From
Miss Jane Atkins." These were the letters which
he had received from her during the honeymoon,
and in which she had bitterly reproached him for
marrying a Papist and a stage singer.


\"And he never showed them to me !" she cried.
\"Ah! there was something noble in poor Richard's
nature, after alL"


The human heart melts towards the dead. Now
that her husband was gone, Maddalena almost loved
him. She clothed him, as women do their lovers,
with ideal qualities; she imagined that he was
generous and high-souled; that weakness was his
only fault. " The poor invalid !" she murmured;
\"and weakness of mind was not a fault in him whose
health this horrible illness had destroyed. He never
spoke to me an unkind word. He allowed that  
  
  
  VOL. II. p
<!-- Leaf 218, Page: 210 -->
creature to torment me; but when at length he was
compelled to choose between us he was ready to
drive her from the house."


As she thought of that last scene, and of the poor
dying man clinging to her like a child, of his sad
and prophetic words, she was blinded by her tears,
and she determined to remain faithful to his memory.
At that moment she avoided with horror the
recollection of Eugenio; for she remembered what it
was that Eugenio had made her wish, and now that
wish had been fulfilled. But these were sentiments
which plaj-ed only on the surface of the heart, and
were soon made to disappear. She found a bundle
of letters on which there was no label. As she
opened them she caught sight of some Italian words.
They were letters from her father, bearing the Baden
post-mark, and had been written by him just before
he had met the Marchese dei Lorini. As she read
them they pierced her to the heart. They contained
the last cries of a man in despair. He reproached
her for not having written to him even once. " Oh,
the wretches ! " she cried; " then they intercepted
my letter as well." He told her of his poverty, his
hunger, his disease. " I am a drunkard now," he
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 211 -->
wrote, " and why ? because with a glass of spirits I
can stifle for a few moments my hunger and my
thoughts." The last letter was awful in its brevity
—" Maddalena, I am dying; succour me !"


From that moment she loathed the house and
all that reminded her of her husband. If her father
had died, his blood would be on this man, who was
also dead. He had stopped these letters from
weakness and in ignorance. But weakness and
ignorance may be often crimes. What are most
crimes, in fact, but dishonesty aggravated by a
blunder ?


She ordered a small trunk to be packed up; she
would start the next morning to Baden-Baden. She
had but enough hope to make her misery suspense.
She felt that he was dead. The last letter had been
dated months before. How long and dark were the
hours of that night. She lay between two corpses.


She made that long journey alone. Her own
maid had been discharged long ago by Miss Atkins,
and one of these country girls would only have
occasioned her trouble and perhaps delay.


As soon as she had arrived at Baden she asked
the way to the cemetery. She sa / a newtombp 2
<!-- Leaf 220, Page: 212 -->
stone, hurried to it, and read upon it her father's
name. She sat there for three hours. At length
she rose. She felt weak and weary, now that she
knew the worst.


But as she passed slowly down the street, her
hand was seized and kissed.  
  
  
  " What, Antonio ! " she cried
\"Yes, signorina, it is I."


\"I am' signora now, Antonio," she said, sadly. " I
have been married."


Antonio looked at her widow's weeds. " You are
very much changed, signora," he said.


\"Yes, Antonio, I have gone through much trouble;
and I have just seen my father's grave." Her lips
began to quiver.


\"We did not write to you, signora, not knowing
your address."


Maddalena recognised the "we" with which an
old servant in Italy speaks of his master. An
indescribable sensation passed through her.  
  
  
  " What!" she cried, looking round her,


\"No, signora, not here. He is in the Black
Forest. I have come here to buy some music for him."  
  
  
  "Then—then the Marchese saw my father?"
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 213 -->

\"Ah, signora, he has been an angel! " exclaimed
Antonio. And he told her all that has been related
to the reader. He did not veil the vices of Restoni,
for he loved Maddalena less than his master, whose
magnanimity he desired to extol.  
  
  
  Maddalena told Antonio about the letters.


"Ah!" she sighed; "had I been here I might
have saved him."


\"No, signora," said Antonio, " nothing could have
saved your father. They say it is wrong to speak
ill of the dead, but it can never be wrong to tell the
truth. You do not know what a man he was."


\"Antonio ! Antonio ! " cried Maddalena,
reproachfully. " How can you speak against him now ? He
is dead. Look behind you at that white stone."


\"If he had been only a gambler and a drunkard
one might have pitied him."


\"Not a word more! " cried Maddalena, turning
upon him like a wild animal at bay.


"But he deserved to have his letters intercepted,
he who intercepted yours and ours."  
  
  
  " What—what do you say, Antonio ?"  
  
  
  " That is all I have to say against him, signora.1
\"But tell me—these letters "
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 214 -->

"I forgot that I was speaking to his daughter,
signora, and that the girls in our country think it
right to adore their parents—let them be what they
may."


\"Antonio, these letters—these intercepted letters
—tell me at once, I command you, sir! Oh, dear
Antonio, look at me; do you wish to kill me ? Why
do you not speak ? "  
  
  
  Antonio told her all.


\"I knew it!" she cried, with a divine smile,
clasping her hands, and raising her large brown
eyes. " I knew it! My Eugenio could not be
false."


She sat down upon a bench and tried to compose
her mind.


The discovery of her father's letters, and now the
discovery of that man's treachery, which had robbed
her of all her happiness, turned her against the two
dead men, and left but one emotion in her mind.
<The old love came back from exile, and sat once
more upon its throne. Eugenio's vision rose before
her, noble and true, as he had ever been; and yet
more, for he had pardoned the man who had injured
him so deeply. He had endured fresh provocations,
<!-- Leaf 223, Page: 215 -->
fresh wrongs; he had sat by his death-bed, and had
followed him to the grave.


Her face saddened, and she looked back towards
the graveyard, and murmured—" May God forgive
him all his sins ! "


\"If my master, who is only a man, could forgive
him, God will, I am sure," said Antonio.


\"You said just now that your master was an
angel, and I think he is one too."


\"That is right, signora; I like to see you smile. It
reminds me of the old days."  
  
  
  "Ah," she sighed, "those old days !"  
  
  
  " Perhaps they will come back," he whispered.


Her face flushed. " Where does he live, Antonio ?
Is it far ?"


"Yes; it is a long way. We must go to Pforzheim
by the railway, then to Wildbad by the diligence,
and then it takes about two hours to walk. Or we
can go there in about five hours with a carriage;
that is the quickest way, only it is more expensive."


\"We will order a carriage at once. Let us go to
the hotel."


\"But first, I have to buy the music; that will not
take very long."
<!-- Leaf 224, Page: 216 -->

Maddalena insisted on buying the music herself;
she put into her bosom the list on which the titles
had been written. How her heart had fluttered

when she recognised the writing ! As she was going
out of the shop she saw a piece of music in the
window, ran back, and pounced upon it.  
  
  
  " What is that, signora ?" asked Antonio.  
  
  
  " Only a stornello," said Maddalena, calmly.


\"Ah, yes !" said Antonio. " II Tempo Passato. I
know it very well, because the Marchese used to be
so fond of it."


\"What, fond of this simple little air ! " exclaimed
Maddalena, in a tone of surprise.


\"Yes, signora. For some time after you had
parted, he used to be always singing those lines—I
forget them now—something about writing and
receiving no reply."


"I remember them," she said, and sang in an
undertone as they walked along—  
  
  
  " Ti ho scritto molte volte imitilmente

Ma sempre invano aspetto la risposta;
Dimmi perchfe ti sono indifferente
Ma scrivi per pietb,, cosa ti cost& ?
Non ti ricordi piu, non ti rieordi piu

Di quei bei giorni :  
  
  
  Ah, tempo passato perche non ritorni."
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 217 -->

Her voice trembled, and she burst into tears,
saying, " I have sung that also, Antonio, many, many
times."


There is nothing so astonishing as the rapidity
with which the most different emotions can succeed
one another. This may be studied at the theatre,
where, within the space of a few minutes, a thousand
people may be seen roaring with laughter and
dissolved in tears. It is the same in life itself.


As the carriage bore her swiftly towards Eugenio,
Maddalena felt drunk with joy; chattered gaily to
Antonio, whom she made sit by her, and laughed
incessantly without apparent cause. Then, on a
sudden, the recollection of her father would come
over her. Her face would sadden, and she would
shed tears, reproaching herself for feeling happy
at such a time. Then the clouds having rained,
would dissolve before the sun; her tear-drops would
sparkle in her smile. She was balanced on a
SEESAW of sorrow and of joy—but joy prevailed the
most.


She asked many questions about Eugenio, and the
faithful domestic told her many lies. How had he
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 218 -->
discovered the plot ? Julie had confessed. How was
it that he had become so poor ? He had lent money
to a false friend. Did he ever speak of her now ?
Yes; her name was always on his lips.


They had now arrived at the outskirts of the Black
Forest. The road became one long hill. It was
skirted with tufts of purple heather, and with green
ferns waving in the wind, and with harebells of a
delicate and tender blue. They rattled over wooden
bridges which spanned silver streams, brawling,
bubbling, flinging spray into the sunshine, and falling
into miniature cascades. They passed by green
meadows encircled by oaken groves, bristling with
bulrushes and speckled with blue and yellow flowers;
and by orchards which, covered with blossoms, had
become gardens; and by little villages with tiny
fields of corn and maize, with bright faces which
smiled at her from windows and nodded to her as
she went by. All nature seemed to welcome her.
She leant back in the carriage, and closing her eyes,
yielded herself up to voluptuous and dreamy thoughts.
She was almost half asleep when she was awakened
by the cold damp air. She looked around her.
They were in the heart of the forest, and were
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 219 -->
toiling slowly up a steep and rugged road. On all
sides stood the pines with their red trunks, stretching
over her their crooked branches, from which the grey
moss hung down in long festoons. The wind moaned
dismally among the leaves. The sun was hidden; a
sombre and unnatural twilight was around.
Sometimes they emerged into a clearing, where the trees
lay stripped of their bark, like naked giants on the
ground, and where briars clambered over grey and
uncouth rocks. Not a house, not a human being
could be seen.


\"Oh, Antonio," she said, shuddering, " what can
make him live in so honible a place ?"


Antonio gave her a disquieted look, and cleared
his throat.  
  
  
  " Signora," he said.  
  
  
  " Yes, Antonio."


\"You must not mind if you find the Marchese a
little—a little strange, you know."  
  
  
  " How do you mean strange, Antonio ?


\"Well, when we lived at Lichtenthal, after your
father's death, he saw nobody at all but me; of
course he did not talk much with me, and that made
him feel—feel "
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 220 -->
  
  "Feel dull," suggested Maddalena.


"No, signora; just the contrary of that. He was
altogether taken up in his work; he used to live
quite in himself; he drank a great deal of strong tea,
and that made him so nervous, that at the least noise
he would start and tremble all over. At last he got
so, that he could not bear to see a man. If he was
out walking and saw any one coming, he would get
out of his way—for, you see, he would be composing
then, just the same as if he was in his room. He
said people annoyed him talking so loud, and not
letting him go by without saying ' Gute tag.' At
last, one day early this spring, he declared that he
could not stand it any longer; that there were too
many people at Lichtenthal; that he might as well
be living on the Boulevards. So he came up here to the
very top of the mountain, and took a woodcutter's
cottage. I furnished it for him as well as I could,
but all he troubled himself about was his piano."  
  
  
  " He is still composing his opera ?"


\"Yes, signora; and it is beautiful to hear. When
he sits down to play, I sometimes think I am in
fairy-land; and once 1 let the dinner spoil. But
much he cares for that! He lives in fairy-land, I
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 221 -->
think. If he is writing, and I tell him dinner is
ready, he nods his head. Then I wait ten minutes,
go again and tell him, and he says, ' Yes, yes; I am
coming.' But he does not come for two hours,
perhaps, or more. So now I tell you what I do. I take
him in some soup, and put it down beside him; then
I watch him. Presently he will stop writing to get
an idea, looks at the soup, drinks a little, and writes
again. In that way I have known him drink two or
three platesful, and if I say to him afterwards—' Did
the Signor Marchese like the soup?' he says, ' What
soup do you mean ? I have had no soup to-day.'"
Antonio chuckled greatly over these reminiscences.
Maddalena looked very grave.


They had now arrived on the summit of the
mountain, and Antonio stopped the carriage before a
little footpath which ran sinuously into the forest.
When he pointed out to Maddalena the roof of the
cottage between the trees, her heart beat so violently
that she was obliged to stand still.


\"Courage, signora," said Antonio, in a faint
voice.


The cottage was a mere hovel, being built entirely
of logs, and in the rudest manner. They were
<!-- Leaf 230, Page: 222 -->
obliged to stoop their heads as they went in at the
door, which had been left ajar.


\"He has gone out," whispered Antonio.
Maddalena felt disappointed, and yet relieved.


A room on the ground floor had been simply but
comfortably furnished. It was almost filled by a
grand piano, on which were scattered several sheets
of music-paper. This reminded Maddalena of her
first visit to the apartments in the Via Larga; but
there the resemblance ended. The walls were bare;
the floor without carpet, and roughly boarded. A
bottle of ink and half-a-dozen books were on the
table, and on the sofa a heap of scores and an empty
plate and dish.


\"Ah," said Antonio, looking at these with
satisfaction. " He has taken the dinner I left out for him."


Maddalena went round the room, touching
everything. She made Antonio show her his chamber,
which was very small, and which contained only
a bed, a chair, and a wash-hand stand; then the
kitchen, which was also small, and in which a
mattress, laid on the floor, and covered with a blanket,
showed where Antonio slept.  
  
  
  " Come, signora," he said, " we shall find him on
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 223 -->
the tower." And he explained to her that close by
was the highest point of the mountains of the Black
Forest. On this eminence a wooden tower had been
built, for the benefit of tourists from Wildbad. It
commanded a view of the Valley of the Rhine, which
was celebrated throughout Germany.


Maddalena recognised him standing on the top
of the tower when they were a long way off. He
was looking at the sky, his arms crossed upon his
breast.


As they mounted the steps they could hear him
muttering angrdy to himself. " He thinks that we
are tourists," whispered Antonio.


Maddalena was almost horrified when, issuing on
to the little platform, she found herself face to face
with Eugenio. He appeared the ghost of his former
self. His dress was disordered, his hair was rough
and tangled; he was emaciated and pale. His hands
were like wax. His eyes shone with the vivid light
which is reflected from sublime ideas. He took her
hand in his, and looked at her vacantly, divided
between two thoughts.


\"Ah, it is you, Maddalena !" he said, at length.
\"You are travelling in Germany, I suppose ? "
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 224 -->

\"I came to see my father's grave, Eugenio," she
replied.


\"Yes," said he, musingly; " I heard down there
that he had died."


\"Oh, Eugenio !" she cried, hiding her head in his
breast and bursting into tears, " you were an angel
to him. Antonio has told me all."


Lorini cast a ferocious look over her shoulder at
Antonio, who hung his head.


\"Come," he said, " let us go to my hut. You
must hear some of my opera."  
  
  
  " Yes; Antonio says that it is very beautiful."


"Oh, he cannot tell! But you—you will be able
to advise me. As for that idiot, he does not find
fault with anything."


\"How can I ?" said Antonio, " when it is all
perfect."


\"Imbecille ! " cried Lorini, furiously; " and I who
fling half of what I write away ! "


"Imbecille" said Maddalena, softly; "thatreminds
me of the old days. Dost thou remember how thou
didst used to scold Antonio ? "


\"Ah, the old days at Florence !" said Lorini.
\"What precious time I wasted there ! What a
<!-- Leaf 233, Page: 225 -->
lifeof idleness and frivolity I led ! I cannot understand
it when I look back upon it now. The circle of
empty fools upon whom I frittered myself away,
and "  
  
  
  " And a poor girl called Maddalena;


\"No, no; I don't say that. Had it not been for
you I should have lived and died a Florentine
writing romanze for the salon. I used to despise
ambition then—wretched fool that I was—but now,
Maddalena, all is changed. I shall become a great
man. Sometimes I believe that I shall become the
greatest composer that has ever lived. Other men
have their styles, but I shall unite all styles within
me. Other operas are mere chapters in music, but
mine shall be a book, harmonious and complete.
II Barbiere is a genteel comedy in music:
Fidelio is a stage symphony: La Sonnambula
is an idyll: / Puritani is an elegy: Norma is
a hymn. Within this little opera of mine, which
shall be but the prelude to greater works, will be
found something of all these. Here we are—I will
begin at once. You recollect the libretto, do you not ?
I read it to you at Florence. Now listen. The first
scene is the corta bandita. A soldier advances and  
  
  
  tol. n. y
<!-- Leaf 234, Page: 226 -->
sings of war, a poet of art, a wandering troubadour
of love. The jester sings a verse after each, and
ridicules each in turn. This is the air—school of
Rossini Why, Maddalena, you are crying ? "


\"I was thinking of my father," she replied,
sobbing.


\"Oh, I beg your pardon," said Lorini, who believed
her; " I ought to have had more consideration for
you, and not have troubled you with my poor opera
at such a time. Can I be of use to you in any way ?
Are you here alone ?"


\"I am alone in the world, Eugenio," she said.
\"My father is dead, my husband is dead. But we
will not talk of that now. Forgive my rudeness in
not listening to you." And going beside him, she
soothed his wounded vanity, and made him sit down
to the piano again. Then he was soon in the clouds,
and passed an hour in playing his favourite passages
and airs.


\"Fool that I am ! " he cried, suddenly; " and I
have not made you sing. Come, the duet. I will
play the air again—now !"


Maddalena sang those words of love with a heart
which rose more than once to her throat.
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 227 -->

\"Your voice is no longer the same," said Eugenio,
coldly. " It is feeble, and full of faults. You have
neglected it, I suppose ? "


\"The signora must be weak from hunger," said
Antonio, coming in at that moment. " She has
taken nothing since this morning."


\"Nor since yesterday," she replied, smiling faintly.
\"Give me some dinner," she said, looking sadly at
Eugenio, " and then, perhaps, my voice" may please
you better."


\"Go to the Jagdhaus and order some dinner,
Antonio."


\"I did that long ago," he answered, bringing
in some fawn cutlets and a bottle of
Assmanshauser. " Now, signora, please to sit down and
eat."


After dinner she sang the air again. Lorini this
time was transported. He wound his arm round
her waist, and kissed her several times. This
made her happy for the day: she did not know
that these kisses came from the artist, not the
lover.


\"In a short time," he said, " you will be perfect;
you must come every day, and " Then he  
  
  
  Q 2
<!-- Leaf 236, Page: 228 -->
stopped. " But where are you to sleep ? You will
have to go to Wildbad, I fear."


"Oh, let me sleep here ! " said Maddalena, taking
his listless hand. "Antonio can make me a bed
upon the sofa. I shall be so happy if I am near to
thee."


\"My dear girl, you cannot do that; you would
not be comfortable—you would turn the room
upside doAvn. Besides, it would be an outrage on les
convenances."


\"Oh, Eugenio, les convenances in the Black
Forest!"


\"It is not so secluded as you think. The place is
infested by tourists—one never has a moment's
peace. But—here, Antonio!—where is the signora
to sleep ? At Wildbad, eh ?"


\"At Wildbad there is an excellent hotel, and the
signora could come up in a carriage whenever she
pleased."  
  
  
  " How far is it, Antonio ?"  
  
  
  " About eight miles, signora."


"Eight miles?—Oh, no! What is this Jagdhaus
where the dinner came from ?"  
  
  
  " It is a kind of shooting-box, signora, with a
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 229 -->
restaurant attached to it for the benefit of travellers.
Yes, they might give you lodgings there; but it is a
very poor place."


\"Not poorer than the house from which Somebody
raised me, I am sure," said Maddalena, with a tender
look upon Eugenio. But his eyes were fixed, and he
was humming something between his teeth.


\"There, now he is composing," whispered Antonio;
\"and you might speak to him a dozen times before
he heard you."


Maddalena shook him: he gave a start like a man
awoke from sleep. " Good-night! " she said, " I am
going."


\"Good-night! " he said, vacantly. " You will find
that the hotel at Wildbad is very good."


\"Yes," she said, laughing; " and I will get up
early, and come to breakfast with thee to-morrow."


\"No, no; don't come to breakfast, because I must
work all the morning. Come in the afternoon, and
I shall have some recitative for you to sing."


"But I will not disturb thee, Eugenio. Let
me come. What am I to do by myself all the
day?"  
  
  
  " Well, if you promise to be very quiet," said
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 230 -->
Eugenio, with an expression of magnanimity and
resignation.


As she followed Antonio to the Jagdhaus,
Maddalena mused deeply on this curious scene. How
much he had been altered ! How different from the
elegant young noble whom she had secretly watched
as he drove to the Cascine in his superb phaeton and
pair ! How different from the tender and thoughtful
lover with whom she had passed that villeggiatura
—the halcyon period of her life ! Yet she flattered
herself that this metamorphosis was merely
superficial; that his manners only, not his mind, had
changed, and that in a short time she should find her
old Eugenio again.


The life which he now led was this. He rose in
the early morning, and having taken a cup of goat's
milk and a slice of black bread, would walk in the
forest, inhaling- inspirations with the first rays of the
sun, the perfume of the dewy flowers, and the
singing of the birds. He would often pass an hour on
the top of the_tower, looking down upon the distant
valley over a sea of waving pines. He would return,
his brain filled with ideas, to write them down,
<!-- Leaf 239, Page: 231 -->
sometimes trying them on the piano. When he had
finished, Antonio would bring him in his breakfast.
He would eat heartily, drinking a little red wine, and
afterwards a cup of black coffee. He would then lie
down upon the sofa : Antonio would give him a
porcelain pipe filled with Latakia; and, as he smoked,
he would read a poem. Sometimes he would lay
down the book to enjoy a reverie; sometimes putting
aside his pipe, he would sing some passage which
struck his fancy to a cadenza which he improvised.
In the afternoon he made Maddalena sing; after which
she would seat herself beside him on the sofa, and
they would converse. She then had interviews with
his mind, and found that it was no less altered than
his face.


It was impossible for one so young and
impressible to be intimate with Jenoure without taking
a slight tinge from the character of that
extraordinary man. Maddalena, like all women who are
affectionate, romantic, and not particularly clever,
could not appreciate wit, and held cynics in aversion.
She was shocked when Eugenio declaimed some of
those bitter paradoxes which he had learnt from
Jenoure, and he turned from her the nobler side of
<!-- Leaf 240, Page: 232 -->
his mind. He spoke to her little of his inner
feelings. He talked to her as a composer to a prima
donna—that was all. When the shades of evening
began to fall, he would rise from her side, and pace
restlessly to and fro. His pale face shining out of
the twilight, his eyes glistening like those of some
wild animal, would make Maddalena shudder as she
looked. Then he would sit down to the piano, and
from underneath his hands wild, weird-like, mournful
sounds would rise. Sometimes he would become as
if possessed, his body would writhe, his long hair
would toss from side to side, and he would extort
from his instrument chords which resembled the
cries of children, the howling of wolves, the roaring
of a storm. And sometimes he would draw forth
such melodies of pathos, such sweet songs of tone,
that she would sit listening as if entranced.


It was during one of these ecstacies that he
composed the dirge of the last act. As he played it she
saw the tears run down his cheeks, and his hands
tremble as they touched the keys.


\"Ah, Eugenio, Eugenio !" she said, sobbing; " I
have been looking for thy heart, and I have found it
here." She kissed him on the brow.
<!-- Leaf 241, Page: 233 -->

\"Do you think that you can sing that ?" he said,
calmly. " You see at the end of each stanza it rises
to a wad—a shriek almost: there is no woman in
Europe who can prolong that note except yourself.
Come, will you try ?"


It was always thus he made haste to escape from
love to art: for him she was no longer Maddalena,
but Restoni.


Nature loves to dispose her phenomena in groups.
Events have their epidemics, and incidents a
tendency to cluster—like the stars.


And so in this inartistic but true history, all who
could have opposed the reunion of our lovers were
suddenly removed. The Baroness and Julie were in
Russia; Atkins and Restoni in the grave. Eugenio
and Maddalena met to live together and—to remain
separated by an abyss.


Eugenio was wrapped in his sublime self. He
had nothing left with which to love. He might
caress her still, but it was with a cold and careless
hand; he might speak to her fond words, but the
tender, trembling tone was no longer there; she was
with him always, and yet she was not with him; it
<!-- Leaf 242, Page: 234 -->
was Eugenio, and yet it was not Eugenio; she asked
for a heart, and she found a brain.


What could she do? How could she struggle
against such a rival ? How outshine an art ? How
contend with an idea ? She determined to wait
patiently until this mania, as she regarded it, had
passed.


But this poor Maddalena could no longer tempt
Eugenio to be unfaithful to his muse. She had
never been beautiful, as I have said before; her
features were all faulty, if examined one by one;
but her eyes had been of great beauty, and gave
expression to this face, as sun shining on a barren
spot will adorn it with a beauty which is not its
own; she had also possessed the indefinable charm
of maidenhood, and her form might have served as a
model to a sculptor.


But now she had become a woman: she had
passed through troubles which had written wrinkles
on her face; the light in her eyes was dimmed; she
had grown cadaverous and thin.


She had only her heart to offer him, and that
was not enough to excite a second love. Men are
ashamed to confess even to themselves that their
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 235 -->
hearts can change with a woman's face. Eugenio
justified himself in not being able to love her, by the
plea that she had married another man on purpose
to give him pain. But if she had been beautiful, he
would have forgiven her for that.


Maddalena had never thought of her looks, except
as she thought of her voice, as something to be
cultivated for the stage. So one day when he said
to her, "Maddalena, you must come out in my opera;
you are the only woman who can sing that part,"
she replied,


\"I must try and get back my good looks first—
at least the little I ever had. Look!" she said,
drawing up her sleeve, " am I not a skeleton ? And
so sallow too. Dio ! what is to be done?"


But as her eyes met Eugenio's, the smile left her
lips. She recognised in them the same expression
as in those of the woman at the station who had

said, "Heavens, what a fright!"


He turned away and sat down to the piano. He
said nothing, and 'his look said so much. The
poor girl went home to her little chamber in the
Jagdhaus, and cried before her looking-glass.  
  
  
  "My God! my God!" she murmured, "what are
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 236 -->
men ? Are their hearts only to be entered through
their eyes ? Well, then, I must make myself
beautiful. I will not starve myself because he
starves himself. I will not fret because he is
unkind. Perhaps I had better go from him for a little
while."


But when she spoke timidly of returning to
England for a short time to look after her affairs, he
entreated her so earnestly not to leave him, he
simulated fondness so well, that she, deceived as women
so easily can be when they really love, persuaded
herself that after all she had a corner in his heart.


But it was only her voice from which he was so
loth to part, and she made that cruel discovery ere
long.


One night it rained in torrents. Eugenio
observed it, shrugged his shoulders, and drew close
to the fire, which had been lighted on the hearth.
Maddalena remained an hour over her usual time;
the storm still raged; she rose to go. He shook
hands with her absently, and 'did not ask her to
stay: he did not think of it; he was composing.
She was too proud to ask for it, and went. Antonio
was not at home, or he would not have let her leave
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 237 -->
the house. He had been caught in the storm, and
had sought for shelter in the Jagdhaus. He was
horrified when he saw Maddalena come in, her
clothes black with rain and clinging close to her
skin. " What!" he cried, " could my master have
allowed you to go from his roof on such a night ?"  
  
  
  " He asked me to stay," said Maddalena.


She caught a grippe which deprived her completely
of her singing voice. Eugenio now exposed the
absolute selfishness of his character: he did not express
sympathy for her misfortune; he denounced the ill
luck which had robbed his opera of its best voice;
he even spoke to her about it in a peevish tone, as
if it were an injury which she had done to him.


He no longer made the pretence of caring for her
now. He turned from those eyes which, filled with
tears, would be furtively fixed on his; he shrank
from her caresses; he left her words unanswered;
he buried himself more deeply than ever in his work.


Maddalena could scarcely have endured this life
much longer. She was no longer a peasant girl,
content to exist in his presence; happy if she could
look at him, and sometimes hear his voice. This is
the adoration stage of love, and to which, when
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 238 -->
once past, the heart cannot return. Maddalena had
enjoyed the rights of equality, and she continued to
demand them. Besides, she had been made proud,
she had been embittered by misfortune. She became
disgusted with this man who would speak of nothing,
think of nothing, but himself. She began to
reproach him; he retorted in kind. There are things
which in such cases one long hesitates to say, but
which, when once said, are frequently repeated.
They often disputed now. At the beginning of a love
quarrels join; at the end, they separate; and these
two finally believed that they disliked each other.


For the space of a week Eugenio worked almost
incessantly, day and night; then a reaction set in;
his brain, spent and exhausted, refused to yield ideas.
His imagination was impotent and limp. He walked
out, but nature no longer inspired him; he sat down
to work, but could not write a note. Tormented by
the desire without the power to compose, he
wandered restlessly about, or sat for hours involved in
gloomy thought.


Maddalena sympathised with him as soon as she
saw how wretched he had become.
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 239 -->
  
  " What is to be done for thee, dear Eugenio ?" she

said.


It was a long time since she had used the tu; as
for him, he always said voi to her now.  
  
  
  " My brain wants repose and change of scene," he

said.


"Why not go to Florence?" she said. "Your
opera is of Florence, and you ought to write it
there."


\"Excellent!" he cried, starting up. " Yes, I will
write my last act there; it is all I have to do.
But—" and his face darkened—" it is impossible : I
have no money. Here I can live as I choose; but
there I am the Marchese dei Lorini."  
  
  
  " Art thou so poor then?"


\"I am throttled. My villa and estates are sold.
I exist on the rents of my palazzo—which do not
come to much."  
  
  
  " The villa sold, Eugenio ! and why ?"


\"Because I gambled them away," he said, sternly,
\"fool and madman that I was."


\"Oh, Eugenio !" she cried. Then her eyes gushed
with love, and throwing her arms round his neck,
she said, " My dearest, why didst thou not tell me
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 240 -->
this before ? I am rich now, very rich; and all that
I have is thine."


\"Signora !" he said, haughtily. Maddalena turned
pale and started back.


"Signora, I am poor, but I have not yet begun to
take alms."  
  
  
  "Alms, Eugenio ! alms from me


"Yes; from you least of all would I take them.
What is this money which you offer me ? How did
you obtain it ? By bargaining yourself away body
and soul."


\"Oh, Eugenio, how can you be so cruel! You
know that my father forced me to marry."


\"What! you try to shelter your dishonour behind
a corpse ! You think that you can deceive me because
your father is no more. But you are mistaken. On
his death-bed he declared to me that you had married
this man against his wish."


\"On his death-bed! Oh, my father, my
father!"


\"And you dare to offer me the money which you
have purchased thus. Listen to me, signora. The
woman who marries a man whom she does not love

is
<!-- Leaf 249, Page: 241 -->
a
\"Oh, Eugenio! Eugenio! for God's sake do not say
that word."


\"She is worse; she sells herself to him not for an
hour, but for a life-time. She sells to him not only
her body, but her mind. Her existence is one
hideous act of shame. Like those poor creatures
whom she professes to despise, love is for ever closed
against her, or can only be purchased by a crime. If
she ceases to be courtesan, it is to become
adulteress."


\"Oh, Eugenio, have mercy on me ! Do you wish
to kill me with your tongue ? My father—oh, God,
that I should have to say it!—my father lied in the
mouth of death. He made me take an oath that I
would marry the man whom he chose for me. My
husband paid him money, and he bade me take
him. Oh, Eugenio ! Eugenio ! what could I do ?"  
  
  
  " Break your oath !" he cried, in a voice of thunder.


\"Break my oath—an oath sworn before the shrine
of the Madonna !"


\"And, pray, which is the worse,—to break an oath
made in weakness before the shrine of the Madonna,
or to make, in cold blood, a false oath before the
altar of God4? With your hand in that man's hand,  
  
  
  VOL. II. R
<!-- Leaf 250, Page: 242 -->
you swore to love, honour, and obey him ! How have
you kept that oath ?"


"I broke it, Eugenio," she sobbed, "for I loved
only thee."


\"Oh, what false weak cowards women are ! They
commit a crime, and say, whining,—' My father
forced me to do it;' and then they bring the
wagesof their infamy to those whom they pretend to love."


Maddalena raised her eyes to his, and said, in a
gentle voice:—


"You have said harsh words to me, Eugenio, and
you have called me cruel names. In strict justice I
deserve it; but from you I had hoped for a little
mercy as well. You should never judge a woman
too severely, dear Eugenio. You know not what she
has to suffer. I wish you farewell now, and may
God ever bless you. Farewell."


She went out, leaving him too stupefied to speak.
He felt uneasy: he repeated to himself the words
which he had just used, and burned from head to foot
with shame.


\"I am a ruffian ! " he cried. " How superior she
is to me ! Who am I, then, to moralise like that ?
Have I been so virtuous ? What have I been but a
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 243 -->
gambler—and something worse. My sins have been
days and nights of deliberate, regulated vice; and I
have paid for them in shame more deep than any she
should feel."


He seized a pen, and spent an hour in writing to
her a confession of his own dishonour, and imploring
her humbly to forgive him and return. In thus
laying bare his own disgraceful scars, he showed great tact
of heart. But he could not see that Maddalena had
left him—not because he had abused her, but because
he had refused to allow her to assist him; because
he had proved so clearly that he no longer loved her.
But as it happened, it mattered nothing what he
wrote. He gave the note to Antonio, who ran with
it to the Jagdhaus as quickly as he could. But it
was too late. He came back, and flung the letter on
the table before his master.  
  
  
  " So you have driven her away at last," said he.  
  
  
  " What do you mean, rascal 1" cried Lorini.


\"Why, she's gone, that's all. There was a party
of tourists at the Jagdhaus. They had room for
her and her little trunk, and click ! clack ! they're
half way to Wildbad by this time."  
  
  
  " Very well," said Eugenio, mastering his emotion,  
  
  
  K 2
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 244 -->
"that will do. I expect her back in a few
days."  
  
  
  " No, you don't," replied Antonio, calmly.


\"Imbecille ! " cried Lorini, foaming at the mouth.
"Leave the room! Leave the house! Get out of
my sight. Let me never see you again."


\"No, no," said Antonio, slowly shaking- his head;
\"I shall never leave you, master. You cannot drive
your old Antonio away."


He knelt down and kissed Lorini's hands, which
began to fondle his grey hairs.


\"Oh, master, master ! " he whispered, " why did
you speak to her like that ?"


\"You were listening then ?" said Lorini, with a
scowl.


\"Of course I was," said Antonio, with sublime
naivete'; " and I was looking too. The door was ajar.
Ah, signore, if you could have seen her face with
my eyes ! But whatever possessed you to trample
on her heart like that, I cannot understand. Our
dear little Maddalena—she who loves you so much ! "  
  
  
  " Do you think she loves me, Antonio ?"


\"Do I think she loves you ! Now I am going to
break my promise, but I don't care for that. Do you
<!-- Leaf 253, Page: 245 -->
know that she used to work like a slave for you ?
Per Bacco ! I had an idle life. She used to cook
your dinner and make your bed, and, rain or fine,
she would take your pitcher to the well and fill it
herself. She would clean the dish and plate which
you had been dining from with her own hands; and
when you were out walking, she would come in here.
She would go about dusting everything. I would
watch her, you know, and presently she would kiss
the book which you had been reading on the place
where your hand had been. When you had finished
your tea, she would come out and pretend she
was thirsty, that she might drink out of the same
cup. I have seen her go and sit in the smoke
which came out of your pipe, and smile when it
floated in her face—she who hates tobacco for itself
When she has been with me in the kitchen, I have
seen her start and blush when she heard you come
in; and often her voice used to tremble when she
spoke of you. We used to speak of you all day
long," said Antonio, softly; " and we used almost to
quarrel who should serve you the most, but I had
always to give in. A little while after she had lost
her voice she changed a good deal. A woman's
<!-- Leaf 254, Page: 246 -->
love is not like a poor servant's. She wants
something in return; and, indeed, that is only right.
She gave up attending to you as she used : perhaps
she was ashamed of letting me see that she cared for
you when you didn't care for her. Ah, master ! how
could you believe that scoundrel of a man ? Did you
ever know him tell the truth ? "


\"How could I disbelieve a man on his death-bed,
Antonio?"


\"Bah ! " said Antonio, sententiously; " men
generally die as they have lived. He did, anyhow. His
last lie was his last word."


Lorini was silent for a little while, and analysed
himself. He was forced to own that Restoni's dying
words had been the chief cause of his outburst of
rage. His virtue had been discharged from his
wounded vanity. He gave a sort of shudder. Our
characters, like our shadows, expand and contract
before our eyes. Sometimes we appear giants to
ourselves, and sometimes dwarfs. Lorini appeared
very small to himself just then.


\"Antonio," he said, " I am sick of this place. We
must go to Florence. You will like that, Old
Faithful—eh?"
<!-- Leaf 255 -->
  
  CHAPTER VI.  
  
  
  
+,


On arriving at Florence, Eugenio domiciled
himself for a short time in the town, but could afford to
pay only for such wretched lodgings, that he told
Antonio to take a cottage somewhere in the suburbs.
Would San Miniato suit him ? asked Antonio.
He had seen an excellent little cottage there.
Yes; San Miniato would do very well. So one
day Antonio bowed him into the cottage which had
formerly been Restoni's. Maddalena had often
pointed it out to Eugenio, who upbraided his servant
for having chosen it. But the latter declared that
it was a mere coincidence; he had known nothing
-of the Restoni having lived there. The first
-quarter's rent had been paid; their furniture was
all arranged. To the great joy of Antonio (who had
his reasons) the Marchese consented to remain.  
  
  
  In returning as an artist to his native city
<!-- Leaf 256, Page: 248 -->
Eugenio looked at everything with new eyes.
Formerly Florence had been to him the Cascine, the
Piazza Santa Trinita, and a series of salons. Now
he spent his days in the Pitti and the Ufizzi
palaces, before the divine works of art which
they contained; he went to the Boboli gardens,
and looked at the sunset on the Apennines, with
their green and golden tints, and their clouds
piled on one another in fantastic forms; at night
he wandered round the Palazzo Vecchio, its turrets
silvered by the moon, and its base blackened by its
own shade. Thus his mind was filled with lovely
images; ideas came back to him; his brain
regained its powers, and ere the summer was over his
opera was completed.


Just then Vivaldi returned to Florence; in the
first cafe" which he entered he heard the news; that
the Marchese dei Lorini, having ran through his
fortune, and having sold everything except the
family palazzo, had returned to Florence; that he
lived in a wretched hovel near the church of San
Miniato, attended by an old servant; that he was
composing an opera seria; and that he might be
seen every day, miserably dressed, walking along the
<!-- Leaf 257, Page: 249 -->
Lung' Arno, with his eyes fixed on the water,
humming something inarticulately between his
teeth, and carefully shunning his former friends.


When Vivaldi went up to the cottage, Lorini
embraced him warmly, called him his saviour, and
declared that he had never been so happy in his
life. He showed the poet his own libretto,
dogseared, stained, and torn. " Ah !" he cried, " for how
much I have to thank this book, every word of
which I know by heart. It dragged me out of an
abyss; it awoke my slumbering, slothful mind. But
listen, Vivaldi, and tell me if my tones are as
harmonious as thy words."


He played the whole opera, Vivaldi interrupting
him from time to time with critical remarks.


\"Well, and now give me your opinion in full,"
said Lorini, as he rose exhausted from the piano.


\"Your opera is very German," said Vivaldi, " too
much so, I fear, for us. It is true that in Italy, and
especially in Florence, harmony is beginning to be
appreciated a little more. But it is only beginning,
and this work is decidedly in advance of the age."


\"I will make the age follow me, like Orpheus the
wild beasts," cried Lorini.
<!-- Leaf 258, Page: 250 -->

\"You may do so in time, caro mio; but you will
have a hard battle first. In a country where Don
Giovanni is not yet admired, the Daughter of the
Donati will "  
  
  
  "Fail?"


\"No; it will not fail. The duet in the second
act, and the dirge and some other airs are Italian
melodies, and will be on everybody's lips. But your
overture and your grand choruses will not meet
with justice here. You have composed them with the
theatres of London and Vienna before your eyes; in
Florence the orchestra and the chorus are too feeble
to execute your ideas."


\"Enough of the Italian public; and your own
judgment as a connoisseur,—what is it ? "  
  
  
  " That your opera is a master-piece.1


"Well," said Lorini, "I prefer the refined praise of
a few dilettanti to the plaudits of a vile and ignorant
mob."


Vivaldi laughed. " You will find those plaudits
very agreeable when you receive them, all the same.
And now I will leave you to see the impresario.
Your opera must come out this winter."  
  
  
  The opera was purchased by the impresario,
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 251 -->
chiefly on the authority of Vivaldi, who was
celebrated for his profound experience of the public.
As soon as it was accepted it was read by the
dilettanti di musica, who plagued Lorini to death
with their advice.


\"These people," he said to Vivaldi, " pretend to
judge of my opera without reading the words. It
is like judging of a portrait without seeing the
original. They come to me and say, ' Such and such
a passage is harsh and unmelodious.' I cannot make
them understand that the libretto is something more
than Victor Hugo modestly defined it to be, Un
canevas d'opera plus ou moins bien dispose pour
que I'æuvre musicale s'y superpose heureusement.


\"No, no, it is more than that, it is a sketch which
the composer fills in with colour, light, and shade.
These fools complain because I throw in some dull
and sombre tints; they want to have it all in pink
and gold. And then these pedants of counter-point
and thorough bass, who have eyes and ears for
nothing but grammatical mistakes! What do I
care about their rules ? If I have made faults
in grammar, so much the worse for their grammar."  
  
  
  But when the parts were distributed, the stage
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 252 -->
properties being prepared, and the opera put into
rehearsal, Lorini began to suffer those torments
which can be realised only by those who have had
the misfortune to bring out a work on the stage.


He had spent days at the public libraries in
studying the costumes and the buildings of the
thirteenth century: out of his slender means he
had paid an artist to copy them, and had taken
them exultant to the theatre. But the manager
declared that he could not afford to buy new
costumes and new scenery for a work the success
of which was by no means certain.


\"Vivaldi, is not this detestable ? " he cried. " My
Florentines are to wear the costumes of Lucia di
Lammermoor, and are to walk in the streets of
modern Venice."


\"RecoUect," replied Vivaldi, " that we are not
in London. The Pergola is small; the public is
limited; the manager is poor. Be reasonable, my
friend."  
  
  
  " I will not be reasonable," cried Lorini.


Now the orchestra revolted, declaring that the
overture was impossible; the wind instruments were
especially indignant, declaring with scorn that they
<!-- Leaf 261, Page: 253 -->
were not Germans. The manager requested Lorini
to re-write the overture; he refused.


The singers began to make complaints, and in
fact they were utterly unable to sing their parts.


Italy, which produces the finest voices, possesses
the poorest opera in the world. It is a preparing
school for the world beyond the Alps, and its
companies are formed of voices which are either
unripened or used up.


The tenor was decayed; the minor parts were
badly filled; the chorus was impotent; the orchestra
mutinous; the scenery and costumes second-hand.
For all these vexations, Lorini was soothed by the
promise of a prima donna. She had already sung
stupendamente at Milan; she at least would do him
justice.


As soon as she arrived, Lorini attended at the
theatre, his expectations raised to the highest
pitch. He was introduced to a little
narrowchested girl, not more than seventeen years of age,
whose delicate beauty partly explained the furore
which she had made among the susceptible
Milanese; she was also a perfect musician, which
explained the rest. As for her voice, it was
<!-- Leaf 262, Page: 254 -->
graceful, but so very weak that (as she afterwards herself
confessed) her parts had always to be adjusted for
her. As soon as she read the dirge, she exclaimed
that it was quite beyond her powers, and that
it could only be sung by an exceptional voice, which
was true. Lorini left the theatre muttering
imprecations, and the impresario had an interview with
him that same day.


II maestro Lorini had preserved all the pride, though
he had lost the polish of the fashionable young
Marchese. Unhappily he had also lost his prestige.
The manager now adopted towards him a manner
and a tone very different from that which from
habit and from empty courtesy he had previously
used.


\"Maestro," he said, " you see that my company
can neither sing nor play your partition. You will
have the kindness to make the necessary
alterations."


\"I mutilate my opera !" cried Lorini, savagely.
\"Never ! If these people cannot sing it, get
others."


"My dear Eugenio," said Vivaldi, who was
present, " your work will be indifferently produced;
<!-- Leaf 263, Page: 255 -->
there can be no doubt of that. But outside Florence
the opera remains your property; have the courage
to look on this merely as a rehearsal."


\"It is a kind of rehearsal which is too public,
amico mio. If they make me render my opera
ridiculous, how will it ever get a footing on another
stage?"  
  
  
  "You refuse then to make thesealterations?"  
  
  
  " Unequivocally."


\"Very good," said the manager, rising. " I thought
it only right to give you the opportunity. But as
they must be made, I shall put the business into the
hands of some worthy man who "


\"You dare not! You cannot! It is my opera ! "
cried Lorini.


"Pardon me, it is mine," replied the manager,
with a low bow; " I have bought it from you, and
paid the money."


Lorini, livid with rage, strode three or four
times up and down the room. Then calming
himself, he turned to the man and said,


\"Well, if it must be done, I would prefer to do it
myself."
<!-- Leaf 264, Page: 256 -->

\"Nobody could do it so well," said the manager
politely, and handed him the manuscript.


\"And it can afterwards be produced in its pure
integrity on other boards," said Vivaldi.


Lorini, clutching the manuscript tightly in his
hands, went out. In a few hours the impresario
received the following note :—


Signore,—I decline to hack down my creation
to the level of cheap voices. I have the pleasure to
return to you the money which you paid to me for
my opera, which I retain. I shall be happy to defray
any further expenses incurred by advertisements, &c.  
  
  
  I kiss your hand,  
  
  
  Lorini.


In a few hours the Marchese received the
following reply :—


Signore,—I beg to acknowledge with pleasure
the receipt of the money which I paid for your
creation. I also enclose a copy of the scrittura,
which you signed, and by which you have now
rendered yourself liable to the usual forfeit—thirty
thousand francs.  
  
  
  I lie at your Excellency's feet,  
  
  
  * * *
<!-- Leaf 265, Page: 257 -->

Lorini mortgaged the family palazzo, and the sum
was paid. Soon afterwards Vivaldi went to Milan,
where a tragedy of his was about to be produced.
After remaining there a month, he would return to
Florence for a few days, and then start for Paris.
It was arranged that he should take the Daughter
of the Donati with him. Already known in Paris as
one of the few original poets whom Italy possessed,
he would be able to push it in the right circles. So
he went, and Eugenio was left alone.


He had no employment now, except to correct and
retouch his opera. But by going over it again and
again his mind became blunted; he lost the faculty
of judgment; like one who lives constantly with a
face, he exaggerated blemishes, and could no longer
recognise charms. He began to suffer those agonies
of doubt and discouragement which seize at one
time or another upon the creators of all untried
works; he feared that the music which so many
could depreciate, and which only his friend and
his servant could praise, must be worthless after
all.


\"Ah, Jenoure, Jenoure," he cried, " you told me
that I should be happy with this new mistress; but  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  I
<!-- Leaf 266, Page: 258 -->
I know not whether I possess her, or whether it is
only a phantom which I hold in my arms."


Like a mother weary of carrying her unborn child,
he led a disconsolate and restless life—neither
occupied, nor yet free—filled with morbid thoughts;
sometimes imagining that his offspring was a
shapeless monster, or that after making him suffer tortures
it would be still-born, and that barren minds would
laugh him to scorn.


He was left alone. His solitude was now no
longer peopled with the lovely fantasies of thought.
It w*as naked, ghastly, and gigantic; it terrified and
crushed him.


And now he felt a yearning for Woman. He was
so desolate and so unhappy. He longed to lean his
head upon some tender breast, to feel a soft arm
round his neck, and words of consolation whispered
in his ear. As some strong man shaking off the ties
of civilisation and domestic love wanders forth into
the desert, exulting in his freedom, so he had created
for himself a wilderness in life. As that man struck
down by sickness, and lying helpless on the sand,
remembers the sweet faces of those at home, so
Eugenio, in this day of loneliness and trouble,
<!-- Leaf 267, Page: 259 -->
remembered Maddalena. He kissed her name, which
he found scratched on a pane of glass; as he lay in
the great curtained bed, he thought with a smile
that she must have slept there too; he walked in
the Cascine, where they had so often roamed together
picking the wild tulips on the banks of the Mugnone,
playing at hide-and-seek among the bushes, and
supping by moonlight beneath those trees, which
now were losing all their leaves. When he found
his old passion springing up within him, as fresh and
tender as if it had known no winter, he was surprised;
for we often think that we have killed love, when we
have only buried it alive in our hearts.


And often at night, when he sat alone in that
wretched room, cowering over the dying ashes, and
listening- to the autumn winds whistling without,
often he would see the shade of Maddalena glide by,
casting on him that last look of sorrow and reproach,
and fading away when he attempted to clasp her
in his arms. Often he would long that her kind
face was there to gladden him with her bright smile,
and to soothe him with her pensive eyes; and often
weeping, he would sing those beautiful verses of
•Sainte Beuve:—  
  
  
  8 2
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 260 -->
  
  ' Lorsque la miit est froide, et que seul dans ma chambre,
Pres de mon poSle e*teint, j'entends souffler le vent;
Pensant aux longs baisers qn'en ces nuits de Decembre
Se donnent les epoux, mon cœur saigne, et souvent,
Bien souvent, je soupire et je pleure, et j'ecoute."


Nor were his troubles only of a mental kind. It
was now winter; food and fuel was dear; he had
little money left. Antonio had long ago spent all
his own savings, without, you may be sure, saying a
word to his dear master. Sometimes they had not

enough to eat.


Lorini bore these trials nobly; once only he
alluded to them. It was a bitter night; he had
eaten so little that he suffered all the more from the
cold. The fire had gone out, and there, was no
wood in the house.


\"You had better go to bed, master," said Antonio,
crying; " you will be warmer there."


Eugenio let himself be undressed, for Antonio
performed his duties as a valet none the less
scrupulously because he was also housemaid and cook.


\"Well," said Eugenio, smiling, " it seems that I
am to be a martyr in the cause of art, and I can bear
these little matters well enough. Eut it is hard for you,
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 261 -->
my poor Antonio; you have not writteu an opera;
you have done nothing- to offend the Fates; why
should you be made to starve with me ?


\"Oh, master," whispered Antonio, " I am very
happy. It is so pleasant to be with you always, and
to do everything for you. It is only for your sake,
that I "


"Tell me, Antonio," he said, patting him on his
withered cheek, " do you think I did right to take
my opera away and pay all that money ? "


\"To be sure, master," replied Antonio, arranging
the clothes round his neck. " The wretches, to
bring a child to sing your music, with her voice like
a penny whistle ! But when we come out in Paris,
they will be punished enough."  
  
  
  " Ay, when," said Lorini, sighing.


At this moment there was a tap at the door, and
an old man came stealthily in. It was a Jew who
lived on the Ponte Vecchio, and who was the most
celebrated usurer in Florence. His black eyes
gleamed, as wandering round the room they counted
all the signs of poverty and distress; the tireless
grate, the common oil-light, the furniture, which
had been reduced to a table and a chair, and the
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 262 -->
scanty coverings beneath which shivered the
Marchese dei Lorini. One ravenous look was fixed on
the splendid piano, which alone distinguished this
room from that of the humblest contadino.


\"What do you want ?" said Lorini. " The
quarter's interest for the mortgage money is not yet due."


\"I would wish to speak with the Signor Marchese
on a matter which may prove to be of advantage to
him."


\"You can speak," said Lorini. Antonio,
havingoffered the usurer the solitary chair, had already left
the room.


\"The Signor Marchese is at present under
slight "


\"No preambles, if you please. You have a
proposal to make, I presume : make it then."


\"The Signor Marchese wishes to have his opera
brought out with an efficient company, with scenery
and costumes of the period, with a powerful
orchestra; in fact, he wishes to have it fairly placed before
the public."  
  
  
  " Such is certainly my wish."


The usurer advanced hischair a little closer to
the bed.
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 263 -->

' Now supposing that the Signor Marchese, instead
of submitting himself to the caprices and ignorance
of managers, were to take a theatre himself, and
organise his own company."


\"An excellent idea," said Lorini, " but it appears
to me, though I am ignorant of business matters,
that a large sum of money would be required to carry
it out."  
  
  
  " A very large sum of money would be required."


\"Well, I don't happen to have it at the present
moment."


"If the Signor Marchese would permit me, I
could point out to him how, by a merely nominal
sacrifice, a large sum of money might come into his
hands."  
  
  
  " How ?"


\"The Signor Marchese has already sold his villa,
his lands, his house and furniture in the Via Larga;
he has also heavily mortgaged the Palazzo Lorini;
he has withdrawn himself from the circles of Tuscan
society; he has no near relatives; no ties which bind
him closely to Florence."  
  
  
  The Jew paused.  
  
  
  " Continue," said Lorini, in an amiable tone.
<!-- Leaf 272, Page: 264 -->

"If he would like, then to sell the palazzo: it is
very old, and would have to be partly rebuilt, but
still if he would like to sell it "  
  
  
  " Antonio ! " said Lorini.


Antonio made his appearance. A lean arm
protruded from the bed, and pointed to the door, which
Antonio opened.


The Jew, stubborn and persistent, like all his tribe,
began to remonstrate.


\"Go," said Lorini, in a deep voice. Antonio
seized him by the collar, and pulled him towards the
door.


\"You will think better of it," said the
unanswerable Hebrew.  
  
  
  Antonio pushed the man out.


But in a few moments he opened the door ajar,
and said :


\"If you ever want to sell the piano, let me have
the first offer, you know."


Antonio ran after him into the road, crying:
\"Sell our piano, you dog of a Jew! why should we
want to sell our piano ? If you come here again,
I will cudgel you all the way down the hill to
Florence."
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 265 -->

\"Empty stomachs make clattering tongues," said
the usurer, with a grin, which showed two rows
of white teeth, glistening like those of a wolf.


Antonio disdaining reply, returned to the
cottage : he looked at his master, who had his eyes
closed : loitered about for a moment, then went
into the kitchen, taking the oil-light with him.


Some days after this Antonio asked his master
if he would not like to see the flood.  
  
  
  " What is the flood ?" said Lorini.


\"Why I have told you half a dozen times, only
you always forget," said Antonio, peevishly. " The
Arno's flooded; and the jewellers on the Ponte
Vecchio have taken away their things; and all the
cellar windows of the Lung' Arno have been bricked
up; and it is a fine sight, the river, they say; and
people are dying by dozens from the miliare fever
because of the water in the streets."


\"Well, we will go and see it, Antonio," said
his master, benignantly, and they went down into
Florence."


Tearing down from the Apennine
gorges,—sweeping trees, stones, crops, cottages, into its savage
<!-- Leaf 274, Page: 266 -->
course,—rolling along muddy waves, great and furious
as those of the sea,—flinging brown spray into the
air,—emitting a rank, earthy smell, the Arno could
scarcely be recognised as the torpid stream of a week
before.  
  
  
  It was an interval between the storms which had

been raging almost incessantly for some days past. A
crowd of people had collected by the river side; men
with yellow torches passed to and fro; above, the
moon flung a tawny light upon the clouds as they
sailed swiftly past.


Lorini leant over the bridge, and gazed with
delight at the dark waters which thundered loudly
under the arches below: sometimes a black and
shapeless mass, the trunk of an uprooted tree, or a
fragment of the railway works which had been
destroyed, would dash against the stalwart stones
with a crash heard loud above the river roar. As the

bridge vibrated, Antonio would cry with fright, and
Lorini would laugh.


\"Oh, come away, master," he said. " See, we are
alone here. It is not safe. Do you wish to kill your
poor Antonio ?"  
  
  
  " Come then," said Lorini, and crossing the bridge
<!-- Leaf 275, Page: 267 -->
he waded along the Lung' Arno till he came in front
of an old palazzo. He stood there for some time,
looking at those stern and massive walls, of which
the stones seem to have been piled together by giant
hands.


\"Antonio," he said, " we are starving, and I have
no heir. I am the last of the Lorini. If I die, this
house will go to people who have palaces of their
own. If I sell it, we shall be rich. What say you,
Antonio ?"  
  
  
  Antonio made no reply.


\"It is hard to feel hunger and to wear rags. It
is harder still for me to be without that money which
would help me up to fame. What is the use of a
title when one is a beggar ? What is the use of
a palace in which one cannot live ? It is mere
mockery, Antonio. It is the sword without the
sheath."  
  
  
  Antonio made no reply.


"Even in aristocratic England old families die
out every day. There it is different from here.
They sell their town-house first. Their villa and
lands go last. But we are citizens, Antonio : we
cling to our old houses in the city while we can."
<!-- Leaf 276, Page: 268 -->
  
  Antonio made no reply.


"Yes, we cling to them," murmured Eugenio,
\"we cling to them while we can. That old palace
was built by Michael Angelo himself. The Lorini
have fought it well ere now. From that gate six
p-onfalonieri have gone forth. Those arms carved
O O
in stone have been looked up to during centuries
with eyes of love and hatred, but never of contempt.
The Lorini have been always held in honour. Our
men have been without fear, and our women without
reproach. Their portraits are inside, Antonio. I
have often wanted to go and look at
them—especially since that old Jew came—but the Marchese
dei Lorini cannot knock at his own door in rags.
There have been times when I wanted courage,
and I knew that those grand faces of the past
would give it me. But now that is over : the
temptation is past. Old house, I will be as strong and
stern as thee. I will not sell thee, for thou art not
mine. Thou hast been won by a thousand brave
strokes of the sword; thou shalt not be lost by
one dastard stroke of the pen. Thou art not
mine; thou art the house of the Lorini; to sell
thee would be a shame, a sacrilege, a theft !"
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 269 -->

\"Oh ! my master," cried Antonio, kissing his hand,
' you are the last and the best of the Lorini."


\"And you, my poor Antonio, will you then be so
mad as to stay with me still ? We are on a weak
bridge, my Antonio, and there is a fierce river
underneath."  
  
  
  Antonio lifted up his aged head,


\"Master," he said, " I have also my family pride in
a humble way. My father and my forefathers have
served the Lorini almost as long as there have been
Lorini. So my father told me: so his told him.
We have served them faithfully; we have bled for
them; we have died for them. There has never
been a coward amongst us yet; and there shan't be
while I live."


Lorini smiled upon him. These smiles were
Antonio's wages.


Then Lorini bared his head, and said, " If the
ghosts of my ancestors still hover round these walls,
I pray them to support me in my hour of need."


Antonio looked at his master. His eyes shone
strangely and his cheeks were flushed.  
  
  
  " Master," he whispered, " let us go home."
\"No," said Lorini, " I feel inspirations coming on
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 270 -->
me. Leave me now. I will be at the cottage in an
hour's time."


\"But do not stay long, master; the miliare is
with us now, and it is dangerous to be by the
river-side."


Lorini plunged into dark and silent streets, and
walked without rest for several hours, his
imagination inflamed by the swelled and swarthy river, by
the memory of his ancestors, and by the first
flametouch of the miliare.


There are some streets of Florence in which at
night one might imagine oneself in the middle ages.
They are narrow and rudely paved : their houses are
ancient and grotesque. Not a light is seen; not a
sound is heard. All is dark and silent. One is alone
with the dead.


As Eugenio stood in such a street he transported
himself into the past. There came lights to all the
windows: he heard voices all round him; then the
doors opened and grave burghers came forth, and
meek-eyed maidens staidly dressed in robes of
woollen cloth; and cowled friars passed by, and
buffoons in parti-coloured garments, and minstrels
<!-- Leaf 279, Page: 271 -->
tinkling their lutes, and noble knights mounted on
prancing steeds.


Yet all the while he was conscious that these were
but visions; that as he stood there his eyes were
closed. He tried to open them, but the lids were
like balls of lead. He gave a laugh, like a drunken
man who tries to sober himself, and cried, in a loud
voice, " My name is Eugenio dei Lorini, and I live
in the nineteenth century."


He saw the sky all reddened by the glow of
flames. He heard the clash of steel, and he saw two
bodies of men in black armour pass by him,
struggling fiercely together, and crying, "A Guelph ! A
Ghibelline!"


\"Costumes of the period, maledetto impresario!"
cried Lorini, whose reason was rapidly forsaking him.


At the same time he felt, as it were, a huge icy
hand being passed slowly over his limbs. But his
brain blazed as if it was on fire, and something
inside his head went up and down in loud and
measured throbs.


Then he heard a loud and dolorous voice. A gloomy
procession came in view. Men robed in white; the
black banner of death; a bier, in which sat the
<!-- Leaf 280, Page: 272 -->
daughter of the Donati, her lover's head lying in her
lap. She was singing the funereal dirge. He
recognised the voice and form of Maddalena. As it passed
by, he peered over at the corpse, and he saw it
was himself.


\"Maddalena !" he shrieked, and fell senseless to
the ground.


A short while afterwards a light appeared in the
distance, and the rumbling of a carriage was heard.
The horse stopped and shied at the body in the road.
The driver got down.


"What is the matter?" cried a querulous voice
from within the carriage.


\"It is a man lying here. He is dead, I think,"
said the coachman.


\"Let me see," said a woman's voice, and the
Signora Pinsuti sprang out, unhooked the carnage
lamp, and held it over the pale and distorted face.


\"It is Lorini," she cried. " Quick ! put him in the
carriage."


\"No, no; I won't allow it," cried the voice of the
Signor Pinsuti, a miserable being whom we have
avoided mentioning before: " it is the miliare, and
we shall catch it from him."
<!-- Leaf 282 -->
  
  CHAPTER VII.


One morning, as Dr. Darlington was receiving his
patients, a lady, fashionably dressed, was ushered
into his room. She raised her veil.  
  
  
  " What! Maddalena !" he cried, starting back.


\"Yes," she said, with a stage laugh; " you hardly
knew me at first, did you ? I am a blonde now. I
come from the hands of Madame Deborah, the
restorer of female beauty. She has enamelled my
face, you see; and blackened my eyelids; and
golddusted my hair. For the future I intend to enjoy
myself. I would go back to the theatre, but,
unhappily, I have lost my voice—and my illusions.
But I shall make myself a patroness of art; I shall
take a petite maison: I shall encircle myself with all
the talent of London. I am not handsome, but I am
rich; so I am sure to have plenty of admirers.
Menare always money-worshippers, and if a woman,
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 275 -->
dresses well, and wears good jewellery, and receives
in elegant apartments, they will be sure to think
that she is beautiful, at least so Madame Deborah
says. Yes, that is the kind of life I am going to
lead; I crave excitement. I have never tasted
pleasure, and I want to know what it is. I am tired of
being good. How do you like me in this dress,
Charles ? It came from Elise. She made just such
a one for the Baroness Sackowsky; now that I have
become a blonde, I can take her for a model. Why
do you look at me in that strange way ? Oh, yes,
I mean to be very happy now. I shall stay in
London till the season is over; then I shall go to
Baden-Baden; then I shall go to Paris. Madame
Deborah says there is a world in the great world
there, where the celebrated Restoni can easily enter,
since she is free and rich. Ah ! well, I have been
celebrated, and now I must be content to become
notorious, I suppose. Charles, Charles, do not look
at me with such sorrowful eyes. It is not my fault.
Have not I gone through enough ? I will not always
pine and suffer, and sacrifice myself. I have always
tried to be good, and I have always been punished
for it. I was a good daughter, and my father sold  
  
  
  T 2
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 276 -->
me. I tried to be a good wife, and they persecuted
me almost to death. I have been religious—I have
been true to him, and, oh my God ! he has driven
me out of his house, and sent me back into the
world with nothing left to live for. My last hope is
gone. I despair. Oh ! how can men be so cruel!
I wish that I did not care for him, but I love him
still; I want to forget him, and I only know one
way."


\"I can tell you another and a better way," said
Darlington, taking her hands in his. " You have
been shattered by a storm, and you wish to sail out
into a hurricane. Come, my child, listen to me for
a little while. I will take you into a haven where
your sweet heart may be at rest."


\"No, no," she said, shaking her head, " it will never
be at rest again."  
  
  
  " Try me at least," he said, " and you will see."


"No, Charles, I do not deceive myself. I shall
not forget him in the life I am going to lead nor in
any other. I shall not forget him till I die, and then
perhaps I may find God more merciful. I want to
die soon, and in this life I shall not linger long. I
am very weak"; I have never been accustomed to
<!-- Leaf 285, Page: 277 -->
the excitements of dissipation and late hours. Yes,
yes, I know what you would say. I am about to
become a drunkard, as fny father was, only my
stimulants will be of a less vulgar kind. I hope that
they will kill me as soon. This is a suicide. I know
it is. I know that I am guilty, and that perhaps I
may never be forgiven; but I cannot help it. I
suppose that my father's sins are in my blood. I
have struggled long and hard against them; but
they have proved too strong for me at last."


She covered her face with her hands, and rocked
herself to and fro. Darlington spoke to her for a
long time; she did not hear what he said; but his
voice soothed her, as a child is appeased by its
mother's tender words while yet unable to
understand then- sense.


There is a convent at Chelsea into which Catholic
ladies sometimes enter, to seclude themselves for a
short time in solitude and silence from the noisy
world, to do penance for past sins, and to prepare
themselves for a future life.


The discipline of this convent is exceedingly severe.
Its inmates rise at six; the whole day is spent at
<!-- Leaf 286, Page: 278 -->
the confessional, in attending divine service, in taking
the blessed sacrament, in reading devotional works,
and in solitary meditation. One hour only is given
to them for meals, and one for recreation, when they
meet to converse on matters relating to religion.


Here Maddalena passed a week. The first day
she was three hours on her knees at the ear of the
confessional. She was compelled to confess the sins
of her whole life, which were almost entirely
comprised within the months of her married life and of
her widowhood. When she revealed the detestable
thoughts which she had sometimes had, most of
which have not been exposed in this history, for they
were known only to herself and to God; when she
heard her own voice saying these things aloud, she
recognised for the first time the full extent of her
sin; she felt for the first time shame and remorse
to the full. This is the chief use of confession : the
utterance of evfl thought is a penance in itself, and
is the first step towards true repentance. I admit
that it would be the same if it were uttered in the
air, cast upon the Infinite to travel up to God. But
as the Church erected temples, and appointed set
days and hours for men to meet together and pray,
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 279 -->
so she has appointed set times and places for
confession, which is the highest kind of prayer.


And because the minds of men, fatigued with the
distance between them and God, are apt to fall back
wholly upon earthly things, the Church has placed
images and paintings before their eyes, not as idols,
but as mediums, as memories, as ladders for their
tottering, turning thoughts; so also she has appointed
priests, isolated from the passions, devoted
exclusively to the service of Heaven, to receive the
outpourings of Christian hearts; who, by imposing upon
them wholesome punishments, may warn them of
the wrath of God; who, by absolving them from their
sins, may remind them of His mercy. For that
which man can pardon, He surely will not punish.
Man is always more cruel than God.


Oh, beautiful ordinance, which even Rousseau and
Voltaire could praise! It was a noble thought which
made thee a sacrament of our Church. It has been
stained, like all sacred things, by the crimes, and
yet more by the calumnies of men. But still there
are many souls who can say, as this poor girl once
said: " When I was on my knees at the confessional,
I felt a load lifted off my heart; I saw my sorrows
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 280 -->
go from me like a storm; and I felt something pass
into me, as it were, from God ! "


"Well, Maddalena?" said Darlington, as he
assisted her into his carriage at the convent gate.


\"You have saved me, my friend," she said, fixing
upon him her swimming- eyes. "Ah, how could I
ever have "


"Hush, my dear," he said; "we will not speak
any more of that. Let us talk about the future.
What do you wish to do ? "


\"I will be guided entirely by you, dear Charles.
Give me your advice. I have formed no plan yet;
only I think that I should like to retire altogether
from the world to some holy house. Have you ever
been to the Sanctuary of Vallombrosa ? I should
like to find a resting-place like that, which lays in
the green bosom of Nature, far removed from the
strife and sounds of this wretched world. No ? You
shake your head. What, then, do you counsel me
to do ?"


\"I advised you, Maddalena, to go to this convent
for a few days. Your mind required discipline and
repose. But I do not wish to see you become an
<!-- Leaf 289, Page: 281 -->
ascetic and a recluse. This peace and solitude of a
week you have found an anodyne; but continued too
long, it would become an evil drug. It would make
you stagnate in cloistered selfishness; committing
nothing, but omitting much; leading a sinless, but
a useless life; making an idol of your own soul, as
Lorini has made an idol of his own mind. No, no,
Maddalena, it is nobler far to remain in the stormy
stream of life; to share and sometimes to soften the
straggles of our fellow-creatures; to endure trials
and to resist temptations. Qui laborat orat,
Maddalena,—work is prayer. But seclusion is suicide,
and solitude is self."  
  
  
  "Do you think, then, that I can do good ?


\"Look out into the streets, my dear; do you see
none there to whom you could do good ?"


"Ah, yes, too many. When I first came to London
I was shocked, as all foreigners are, by the horrors of
your streets. And at first I put money into the
hands of every starving wretch I met, but I soon
gave it up in despair."


\"Yes, the misery of London is so vast that it
would engulph the riches of all the Rothschilds like
a rain-drop in the sea. Our poor-laws suck in huge
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 282 -->
revenues; our hospitals are ' supported by voluntary
contributions;' we have charities of almost every
kind, which the ingenuity and benevolence of man
could suggest; and yet men die of frost and famine
at our doors."  
  
  
  " Oh, it is frightful! " she sighed!


\"But," he cried, with energy, " do I cease to heal
sickness because I cannot eradicate disease from the
world ? Will you shrink from before this monster
because you cannot kill it with your own hand?
Maddalena, in this city there is an army of patient
and laborious hearts, who work only to succour the
poor and the distressed. Their means are small;
their efforts are silent and are scarcely seen; but
they work on. Will you join us, Maddalena ?" *'■


The great women-singers have been celebrated
almost without exception for their generosity. How
many anecdotes are told of the charity of Catalani,
Malibran, and Jenny Lind ! But in the new life
which Maddalena now embraced, she devoted her
mind as well as her money. She toiled from morning
to night, visiting the poor and sick in their own
homes, nourishing their bodies and their hearts.
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 283 -->
Charity is not only donation, but discrimination;
immense as Maddalena's wealth was, she was forced
to husband it with care; her heart was fortunately
guided by the doctor's head, and he thought it best
to warn her against the counterfeit misery which
passes current in the streets. The professional
beggars had at first found a mine in Maddalena;
they had placed her name in their books, and a
mark indicating charity upon her door-post. But
Darlington observed this as he came to visit her
one day; he laid in wait; presently a man
artistically crippled limped up to the door; the doctor
warned him off in the patter, or secret language
of thieves and cadgers, and chalked a hieroglyphic
denoting danger on the door-post.


Maddalena became so happy that she recovered
her health and her good looks. Her voice was
restored to her during a violent cold which she had
caught—nature apparently turning homœopathist.
She sang sometimes at concerts for benefits, and on
behalf of charitable funds, but felt no desire to return
upon the stage. All ambition had died within her,
except that of doing good. Philanthropy was now
her art; and an art it really is with its terrible toils,
<!-- Leaf 292, Page: 284 -->
its constant novelties, its bitter disappointments, its
moments of transport, ethereal and sublime. She
performed two actions only which had reference to her
past life. Hearing that Miss Atkins was living in a
state of indigence, she conferred a handsome annuity
upon her. Miss Atkins sent her a letter of slimy
adulation; told her friends that the Jesuit who had
forged her brother's will expected to compound with
Heaven for her sins for five hundred a-year, and
married her butler. He shortly afterwards had a
\"call," and they speculated in a chapel. The " call "
did not answer; the tabernacle went to smash; and
the worthy pair now keep a public-house in the
neighbourhood of the Edgeware Road.


She also directed her solicitor to purchase, if
possible, and at any terms, the villa Lorini and the
lands thereunto attaining. She determined to leave
them to Eugenio. " He will not refuse them when I
am dead," she thought.


The solicitor discovered that the property had
been purchased by one Maynard Jenoure, of the
Travellers' Club, Esq.; and shortly afterwards
Darlington received this letter, dated from St.
Petersburg -.—
<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 285 -->

\"Mt dear Charles,—Your letters have all come
to hand, and I have been much amused in reading
' O
the adventures of our friends, and still more your
' treatment' of the little Restoni.


\"I have been told by doctors that bread pills are
sometimes a most powerful therapeutic remedy,
being conferred with active agencies by the
imaginations of the recipient. Thus, in one case being
administered as a cathartic, they have had the required
effect, after salts, castor-oil, and other aperients had
failed. Given as a tonic, they have been known
to brace the system, create a cheerful appetite, and
restore health to the system, and under the name of
mercury they have even produced salivation and

spongy gums.


\"It seems to me, my dear friend, that you have
been physicking Restoni with religion in pretty
much the same way. You do not believe in
Catholicism any more than you believe in the Brahmins,
the Buddhists, or the ancient Druids; you know that
creeds are all bread pills, neutral bodies, which
simply serve as a fulcrum, by means of which the
imagination works on the mind; you know that the
physicians of the mind, like those of the body, must
<!-- Leaf 294, Page: 286 -->
stoop to a little artifice sometimes. You have done
so, and you have succeeded. Receive my
congratulations.


"Apropos of that young lady, I have just had a
letter from my lawyer, who tells me that she wants
to buy the Lorini- estate. I suppose that I must
consent. It is very clear that she means to marry
that youth, and (mark my words) she will. I have
always said this :—If a man determines to possess a
woman, or if a woman determines to marry a man,
give them time and opportunities and they must
succeed. I look upon it as a certainty that
Maddalena will many my poor young friend. May she be
happy ! I do not think she will.


\"There are two natures in Lorini's mind; and his
future life, like his past life, will be a SEE-SAW
from one to the other. He is a man of society, and
he is an artist.


\"If he marries this girl, he will become rich;
naturally slothful, he will feel disinclined to work; if his
opera should be successful, he will say that he does
not wish to risk his reputation; or if it fails, he will
be discouraged, and say that he has mistaken his
vocation. He will go to Paris; there his talents, or
<!-- Leaf 295, Page: 287 -->
rather his genius—for a genius I believe he is—will
make him the rage. He wdl enter a world of which
the crowds in London and his paltry coterie in
Florence will have given him no idea. He will be
courted by the wittiest and most elegant women in
the world. What will become of his wife, who has
neither breeding, beauty, nor brains ? My dear
Darlington, he will sjiend her money, and bum her
to death over the slow fire of neglect.


\"Supposing that he resists these temptations, and
remains composer ? Worse and worse. The woman
who marries an artist is a fool. Let her read his
books, look at his pictures, listen to his music—but
live with him ! Why, it is like attempting to enjoy
a spectacle by going behind the scenes.


\"The artist has not only his hours of long manual
work like ordinary men: always subject to the
despotism of his ideas, he indulges in vagaries of
action, and in irregularities of life, with which his
wife will attempt to combat, but in vain. Then
how can an ordinary mind comprehend those deep
abstractions of thought in which the artist is so often
buried, and in which an affectionate word is a
disturbance, and a caress an interruption. His wife
<!-- Leaf 296, Page: 288 -->
  
  explains these by supposing that she has offended  
  
  
  him, or that he is thinking of another woman.


\"The Avife of a genius must be content to lie at her
husband's feet, to watch his eyes, to smile when he
gives her a glance, to lick his hands furtively, and to
embrace him when he can spare the time. We hear
very often of women who can do this, but I have
never met one yet.


\"In marriage there are mesalliances of mind, my
friend, as there are mesalliances of rank. Such
men as Lorini and myself live upon the
mountaintops; the air is too thin and refined for minds like
that of Maddalena. Only eagles can breathe it and
live.


\"I do not often speak in earnest, but this is a
subject upon which I cannot jest. You know that I
speak from experience now. You remember the
romantic period of my life, do you not ? If you wish
to save Maddalena from her fate, and Lorini from
mine, never let them see each other again. If you
have still the manuscript which I wrote soon after
that unhappy event, give it to Maddalena to read.
Yet what would be the use ? She loves this
Lorini, and she will go back to him, like the moth
<!-- Leaf 297, Page: 289 -->
to the flame, at which it has already singed its
wings.


\"As for myself, I am here at St. Petersburg
studying Revenge. I am occupied, and therefore I
am as happy as I can ever hope to be. As in the
body the oxygen which is inhaled supports life by
consuming the fuel which is offered to it: but if no
food is there devours the tissues themselves, and
kills: so it is with my unhappy mind. I must work
—work—work—feed this monster who cries out for
food, or it will turn and rend me of my reason or my
life.


\"But happily I have raised up for myself a
threefold task, which would exhaust a dozen ordinary
lives, and which even I, with my wealth, my energy,
and my rapidity of execution, shall never be able to
complete.


\"You remember I told you that I intended to
paint a series of pictures which should portray the
Passions of man. To these I had afterwards the
idea of adding the Emotions.


"I have now had a grand conception. I shall
paint a work of Fiction. Each picture shall be a
chapter: each series of pictures a book. A story  
  
  
  VOL. II. U
<!-- Leaf 298, Page: 290 -->
shall run throughout them as in the Rake's Progress;
but while that is a mere biography, this shall be an
elaborate and enormous work. It shall depict all
the passions and emotions of the human race; all
the phases of society; and all the types of civilised
man. You will see at once what great advantages
I possess over the novelists of the pen. I shall not
be able, it is true, to make my personages speak;
but how much better the character of a face or a
landscape, a situation or a denouement, can be
described in colours than in words !


\"My second task is to travel in those distant
countries which are so little known, and of which
the vague accounts of travellers only serve to
tantalize men of science. I shall carefully select
specimens from different tribes of savages, and make
portraits of them. I shall do with rare men what
Audubon did with rare birds. I shall paint a
museum; and thus science, furnished with exact
materials on the configuration and complexion of
the doubtful races, may be able to arrive at some
definite conclusions.


"Thirdly, should I ever live to carry out these
two gigantic designs, having by that time read all
<!-- Leaf 299, Page: 291 -->
the great books, studied all the great languages,
travelled everywhere, and seen everything, I shall
begin to paint the History of the World.  
  
  
  " Maynard Jenoure.'


As Darlington was musing on this singular letter,
he saw Maddalena's carriage drive up to the door.
They had made an appointment to see each other at
that hour, regarding a benevolent scheme which
they had in hand. In London there is no hospital
for children. Such an institution is required, not
only by charity, but by science; it is of
importance that medical men should have better
opportunities of studying the special maladies of those poor
little creatures who sicken and die by hundreds in
our noxious courts and alleys.


As soon as she entered, he saw that something
extraordinary had occurred. Her face was flushed,
and her movements nervous and excited.  
  
  
  " Oh, Charles," she cried, " he is starving ! "


Darlington sighed. " There are many who starve in
London every day. Tell me the case."  
  
  
  " It is he ! "  
  
  
  "Who?"  
  
  
  n 2
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 292 -->

\"The man who took me out of a peasant's
cottage, and who is now forced to live in one—in the
same one himself. The man who plucked me from
a life of misery—my benefactor, my lover, my
Eugenio !"  
  
  
  Darlington sighed again


"Read this," she said, and gave him a letter
written on coarse paper, with faint, brown ink, and
abounding in blots and orthographical mistakes.


\"Most excellent Lady,—I take the liberty to
"write a letter to you, thinking that you would like
to hear some news of Florence, which is your native
city. A little while ago the King was here from
Turin, and drove in the Cascine every day. There
was a grand ball, and also an illumination. A
woman was murdered the other night on the steps
of the Santa Maria Novella. The Madonna in the
Duomo has got a new dress, which is very beautiful.
There is a flood here now, which has broken down
the railway between Florence and Leghorn, and the
miliare fever is very bad.


\"We are living now in the little cottage at St.
Miniato, where you used to live. The opera is
finished, but that villain of a manager wanted the
<!-- Leaf 301, Page: 293 -->
Marchese to mutilate it because he had engaged
people who could not sing. So my master took it
back; then they made him pay forfeit; and he had
to sell the rents of the palazzo for the next five
years, and we have very little money left; and the
old usurer will not let us have any more. He
says that he has got a bad bargain as it is : that
my master will not live five years—he who has
such strong health. It is true that he is rather
pale and thin just now, but then one does not fatten
upon chestnut bread. We know what the Jew wants,
but a Lorini would rather die of hunger than sell the
palazzo of his ancestors.  
  
  
  " Your most humble and devoted servant,  
  
  
  "Antonio."


"You will send him some money, will you
not ?"


\"Send him money! Charles, where is your
heart ? "  
  
  
  " I have none for such an egotist.
\"Oh, no, do not call him that."
\"What do you mean to do ? "
\"Why, go to him, of course."
<!-- Leaf 302, Page: 294 -->
  
  Then you are going to fall in love with him

again.  
  
  
  " Again ! no. I have never ceased to love him.


\"Not even when he abused you, I suppose," said
Darlington, in a tone of irony.


"Ah, Charles, you do not understand a woman.
I never loved him so much as I did then. How

noble he looked when he drove me from him.
And he was right. I, who could marry a man
whom I did not love, I was not worthy to live with
him."


\"This is utter madness," said Darlington, pacing
up and down the room. " The man does not care for
you."


\"If he did, would there be merit in my loving
him ?"  
  
  
  Then she gave a sly smile.  
  
  
  " But he is living in the cottage where I lived.


\"Poor girl! poor girl! " sighed Darlington. " I
have brought you into smooth waters, and now you
will go from me into stormy seas to sail and sail till
you are wrecked at last."


\"For what are ships built ?" said Maddalena,
\"and for what are women made ? Yes, I will sail
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 295 -->
among the storms if I carry with me Eugenio, and
if love takes the helm."


"When love takes the helm, the ship is very
badly steered. But what is the use of arguing
with a woman, when the man she cares for is in
trouble ?"


\"Ah, you understand us a little after all, I see.
But while we are talking, Eugenio may be starving.
When shall you be ready to go ?"  
  
  
  " What! " cried Darlington.  
  
  
  " How soon will you be able to start ?'
\"Where ? "


"With me to Florence. I have packed up my
things."  
  
  
  Darlington gave a scornful laugh.


"I am not in love, Maddalena, and therefore
retain the possession of my senses. I shall be happy
to escort you to the station."  
  
  
  " How can I travel all alone?" she whispered.


\"I will put you under the care of an old servant
whom I can trust."


\"Oh, no, that will not be the same. Besides,
perhaps—perhaps he may be ill."  
  
  
  *< Oh, indeed ! " said Darlington; " oh, indeed !
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 296 -->
Perhaps he may be ill. And on the bare chance of
this "  
  
  
  " Charles !"


\"Of this Italian noble being ill, I am to desert
all my patients."  
  
  
  Dr. Rudderforth will attend to them while you

are gone.


\"And this is friendship ! Oh, Maddalena, there
is nothing so selfish, so pitiless, so- unreasonable as
a woman in love.


"Charles, come with me," she whispered; and
throwing her innocent arms round his neck—" Yes,
this is friendship ! It is sacrifice. Would I not
make as great a sacrifice for you ? You know I
would. Come, Charles, Carlino mio ! this is the last
service you may ever be able to do me. It is not a
whim, my friend, my brother; it is a wish—a craving
which I cannot explain to myself."


"But," said Darlington, whose voice from
contemptuous had become only firm, and now a little
feeble, " I am advertised to read a paper before the
Royal Society next Wednesday night."  
  
  
  " Have it postponed."  
  
  
  "I am under an engagement to write several
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 297 -->
scientific articles and reviews before the end of the
month."  
  
  
  " You can write them on the road."


Darlington looked over the letter again. The
miliare fever is very bad. " I want to study the
miliare," he said, in a hesitating tone.


"That is right," she said, "you have a scientific
excuse. We shall be able to start this afternoon,
shall we not ? "
<!-- Leaf 306 -->
  
  CHAPTER VIII.


A carriage was crossing the campagna of
Florence. It was night. The cold wan wilderness
lay around. A mist was rising from the bowels of
the earth. On the brink of the horizon the
Apennines loomed forth in monstrous and forbidding
shapes. Above, the moon flung a tawny light upon
the clouds as they sailed swiftly past.


\"Charles," said Maddalena, as she clasped his
arm, " do you believe in presentiments ?"


\"In physical disease," he said. " In epilepsy, for
example, and in fever, the patient has often a vague
fear of coming evil. This is the first symptom of
the malady itself."


"And may not the mind have' its instincts as
well as the body ? May not human beings be able
to feel an evil which is drawing near ?"  
  
  
  He shook his head. "I have experienced
<!-- Leaf 307, Page: 299 -->
prosentiments myself," he said, "frequently enough.
But happily they have not come true. They may
be traced nearly always to deranged digestion, or to
simple depresson of the mind."


\"Charles," she cried, " something dreadful is
going to happen. I feel a storm in the air. Holy
Mother, have pity on me ! Have I not endured
enough ? "


"It is this gloomy night which causes your
apprehensions," he said. " If we could have gone
by railway, you would have felt nothing of the
kind."


He felt her pulse. " You have a slight attack of
fever," he said. " That alone would account for your
fears. Cheer up, Maddalena, and I ■"


"Ah!" she cried. Her face became ashy pale,
and she followed something with her finger through
the air.  
  
  
  "What was that?


\"I saw Eugenio," she said. " He passed by me
dressed in ragged clothes, and his eyes were closed."


Darlington shouted to the postilion, who cried
and cracked his whip. The horses galloped rapidly
along.
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 300 -->

Darlington was not superstitious, and it is
superstition to disbelieve whatever we cannot explain.
He had himself seen the vision of a friend twice.
On the first occasion his friend had at that same
hour been taken seriously ill; on the second
occasion at that same hour he had died.


They were close to Florence. They could already
see the lights.  
  
  
  " Hark !" said Maddalena.


He listened, but could hear nothing. He
supposed that it was another of her illusions.  
  
  
  " I hear the psalm of death," she said.


Her senses, sharpened by the fever, had heard the
sound several minutes before it became' audible to
him.


He looked out and saw men dressed in white
robes app-roaching them and carrying torches in
their hands. They were taking a dead body to some
burying-place outside the town.


As they passed, the red glare of the torches blazed
in Maddalena's eyes. She covered them with her
hands and cried, " It is a prophecy ! "


As soon as they had arrived at the hotel,
Darlington made her go to bed, and gave her a composing
<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 301 -->
draught. He pacified her by saying that he would
go and seek for news of Lorini at once.


The servants of the hotel who had admitted them
were French, and knew nothing of the town.
Although it was past midnight, Darlington went
out into the streets, resolving to remain absent an
hour or so, then to return to Maddalena, and if she
was still awake to tell her that " Eugenio was
well."


Presently he heard the tinkling of a bell, which
became more and more distinct. And then, as if by
magic, wax candles were brought to the windows
of every house. The street became illuminated till
it was as bright as day.


A priest appeared clad in gorgeous robes, walking
under a yellow canopy, and chanting from the ritual
which he held in his hand. He was followed by
choristers, and by a crowd with uncovered heads.


Darlington took off his hat and followed with the
rest. He was told that the priest was going to
administer the last sacrament to a dying man. They
passed through several streets, each of which was
lighted up as they went by, till they arrived
before a large and beautiful building. They
<!-- Leaf 310, Page: 302 -->
entered it by a colonnade decorated with al frescoes,
and Darlington saw that it was an hospital.


As the priest crossed the threshold, he sang,
\"Pax huic clomini."


And all the people chanted in response, " Et
omnibus habitantibus in ea."


The priest, followed by the crowd, passed up an
immense room built in the form of a cross, and
conoregated round a bed at the further end.

O O


Darlington, unable to get near, loitered behind the
rest. It was a strange scene, that great and silent
moving crowd; the sick raising themselves in their
beds and watching it pass with haggard eyes; the
nurses clustering together in their blue gowns, with
their bare arms folded on their breasts; and a
group of students standing round the stove, laughing
and talking loudly with one another.


To these last Darlington approached, and said,
\"What is the case, gentlemen ? "


They immediately recognised the doctor by his
tone, and replied," Here comes the Professor, signore."


A tall man came from the bed, shrugging his
shoulders, and looking back at the crowd with an
air of comic disdain.
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 303 -->

s" The stag must be surrendered to the vultures,"
he said. " I can do no more."  
  
  
  " What is the case, signore ? " asked Darlington.


\"Last stage of the miliare. Complete collapse
and insensibility."


\"Excellent! " said Darlington. " Signore, I have
come to Florence for the purpose of making an
experiment on these cases. My name is Darlington;
some of my works have been, I believe, translated
into Italian."


"And into all other European languages. My
name is Melzi."


\"Then we know each other," said Darlington,
replying to the bow. " Now, from certain
experiments which I have made upon the nervous system,
I am inclined to believe that ice applied to the spine
in the last stage of miliare and other diseases, will
have the effect of preserving, or rather, I may say,
of restoring life."


\"You shall try it, signore, you shall try it as soon
as this mummery is over. We are not at Madrid
or at Rome, where science is completely
priestridden. Still it would be difficult to interrupt them
at this moment. They are administering the sacred
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 304 -->
oil now to his eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, hands, and
loins, and granting him plenary indulgence for his
sins. Then they will give the 'Benedictio in articulo
mortis,' and after that the ' Recommendation of a
Soul departing.' They will not be very long. They
have finished the extreme unction already, it seems*"


\"Kyrie eleison ! " cried the priest. " Christe
eleison ! Kyrie eleison !"


At that moment the crowd waved backwards;
some whispered voices were heard. Two nurses
dived in, and came out, bearing the body of a
man.  
  
  
  " What is that, Maria ?" asked the Professor.


\"It is an old man who has fainted, signore," said
the nurse. " They say he is the servant of the
dying man."


"I dare say it is another case of miliare," said the
Professor. " If so, signore, you will have two strings
to your bow."


The students laughed, and followed him towards
the bed where the old man had been laid.


\"By the way," said Darlington, " can you tell me,
signor, if the Marchese dei Lorini is still in
Florence ?"
<!-- Leaf 313, Page: 305 -->

The Professor stood still, and looked at him
aghast.  
  
  
  Darlington saw himself encircled by astonished

eyes.  
  
  
  " Who did you say ?"  
  
  
  " The Marchese dei Lorini."  
  
  
  The Professor pointed to the bed.
\"He is there!"

w


Darlington gave a cry, burst through the kneeling
crowd, and bent over the body which was stretched
upon the bed.  
  
  
  " Ice !" he cried : " bring me ice !"


"Away with you, profaner !" cried the crowd.
"Down with the heretic !"  
  
  
  He was seized, and torn straggling from thebedside.


The priest recited rapidly the " Benedictio in
articulo mortis."


\"Down with superstition!" cried the students,
and, uniting together, they dashed into the crowd,
dealing blows in every direction. A hideous struggle
took place around the dying man; it was only ended
by the priest, who ordered his adherents to come
round him. Then there was a pause. On one side  
  
  
  VOL. II.  
  
  
  X
<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 306 -->
of the bed stood Darlington, encircled by the students;
on the other the priest, surrounded by a crowd, now
kneeling and still. It was the " Recommendation of
a Soul departing."


\"Depart, Christian soul, out of this world, in the
name of God the Father Almighty, who created
thee: In the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living
God, who suffered for thee : In the name of the Holy
Ghost, who sanctified thee: In the name of the
Angels, Archangels, Thrones and Dominations,
Cherubims and Seraphims: In the name of the
Patriarchs and Prophets, of the holy Apostles and
Evangelists, of the holy Martyrs and Confessors, of
the holy Monks and Hermits, of the holy Virgins,
and of all the Saints of God: let thy place be this
day in peace, and thy abode in holy SiON, through
Christ our Lord. Amen."


\"Remain, faint spark of life," murmured
Darlington, bending over the motionless and prostrate
form; "oh! remain, faint spark of life, tdl I can fan
thee to a flame."


The priest continued his prayers. The body was
turned, the back bared, and the ice applied to the
knotted curling spine.
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 307 -->
  
  The priest closed his book and said :—


\"Dear friends, our brother here has now been
absolved from all his sins; he has been anointed
with the holy oil; he has received the last blessing
of the Church. We have saved this poor erring soul
from the hands of the great Enemy, and the sweet
Shepherd will now receive him among His flock."


But the crowd tossed and undulated and uttered a
low cry, and dragged itself along on its knees towards
the bed. They had seen the body shudder and turn
upon its back, and a live face stared at them with
open and bewildered eyes.


\"Gentlemen," said Darlington, in the cold tone of
a Professor, " the experiment, as you see, has so far
met with success, and I am happy to inform you
that the patient's life will, in all probability, he
saved."

<!-- Leaf 316 -->
  
  CHAPTER IX.


Darlington gradually explained to Maddalena
what had taken place. She wished, of course, to live
at Eugenio's bedside; but abandoned this desire
when he said that her presence might murder him
with joy. He allowed her, however, to visit Antonio,
who was also sick with fever, but who, having learnt
that his master lived, was rapidly recovering.


Antonio lay in the great ward. Lorini's bed had
been rolled into one of the little rooms which are set
aside in Italian hospitals for private patients, who,
by paying a small sum per diem, receive the best
nursing, diet, and medical attendance that the town
can afford. In London, unhappily, this arrangement
is as yet unknown. How many there are in the
middling classes who may not seek a pauper's bed in
the hospital, but who during a long sickness in the
solitude of lodgings are plundered by their landladies
<!-- Leaf 317, Page: 309 -->
and servants, neglected by their hired and
tinwatched nurses, and who rise at length to find
themselves hopelessly embarrassed by their doctor's
bill.


Maddalena nursed Antonio, pouring out upon him
those treasures of love which belonged to Eugenio,
and which he could not receive. Antonio rewarded
her by talking of him.


\"The Signora Pinsuti." he said, " has done us evil,
but she atoned for it that night. She found him
lying all but dead in the street; she carried him to
the hospital, and she even sent up to me to say that
my master was dying. When I heard this, I ran
down here as fast as I could. I found him lying on
the bed with twenty doctors standing round him.
He did not know me. I hung over his mouth, and
I took in his feeble breath. I thought perhaps that I
might catch the fever like that, and take it away
from him. And, you see, I did ! " said Antonio, with
an air of triumph. " The Doctor thinks he cured
him with ice; and I say to him, ' Ah ! yes, Doctor,
that was a grand cure. What a mercy it was that
you came intime!' Then I laugh at him in my
sleeve."
<!-- Leaf 318, Page: 310 -->

\"And if you had not saved him, Antonio, what
would you have done ?"


"I should have died, of course," said Antonio,
simply. And then he added, smiling, " I thought of
that, too. I I thought that we should be laid in the
Mortuario together, and perhaps they might have
buried us both in the same grave. Yes, and I felt
myself dying, too, till the Doctor came to me and
said, 'My good Antonio, your master is saved.'
Then I gave a bound within myself, and I said, '
Antonio, my friend, you must live ! What will the
Marchese do without you ? He cannot hire a
servant, and who is to cook his dinner—when there is
anything to cook ?' Ah! signora, we have gone
through hard times of late."


"Antonio," she said, " I know that you have saved
some money from your wages : why did you not buy
some food with that, and send to me ? You know
that I would have paid you back."  
  
  
  Antonio looked at her with an air of mild surprise.


\"I paid the rent of the cottage with my savings,
signora," he said.


"He accepted money from you, then?" said
Maddalena, with a pang of jealousy.
<!-- Leaf 319, Page: 311 -->

\"He did not know it," said Antonio, with a
chuckle.


\"Oh," thought she to herself, " how superior is this
old man's love to mine ! He serves his master like a
slave; he secretly supports him from his own poor
means; and he finds it quite natural to die because
he is dying, to live because he is saved. Antonio,"
she said, taking his hand, " those hard days are over
now. I am coming to live with you again."  
  
  
  " Ah, that is right," he cried.


\"If he will not let me live with him, I will live
near to him. If he does not wish to see me, he
shall not see me, but I shall see him sometimes,
shall I not, Antonio ? "


"Oh, yes," said Antonio, rubbing his hands, "you
shall see him. I will take care of that; and I will
come to you every day, and tell you what he says
and what he does."


"Yes," said Maddalena, sadly, " I will live by his
side if it must be by stealth; but I will never leave
him again."


"But, signora, there is no need to talk of that.
He will not let you go away. He is very sorry for
what he said."
<!-- Leaf 320, Page: 312 -->

\"But he will refuse to let me help him," she said.
Then her face brightened. "Antonio," she said,
\"I have bought the villa and the estate."  
  
  
  "Ah!"


\"And I have left them to him in my will. He
will not refuse them when I am gone."


\"I tell you what we will do," said Antonio. " As
soon as he is strong enough, the Brothers of the
Misericordia shall cany him up to the villa. He
shall see you there for the first time; and then if he
should refuse, he will not have a heart."  
  
  
  " And if he has not a heart, Antonio ?'  
  
  
  " Then go back to England."


\"And you, would you wish to serve a master who
has no heart ? "


\"Oh, it is different for me," stammered Antonio.
\"I am only a servant, you know. I love him,
to be sure, but that is no reason why he should
love me. Sometimes he gives me a smile or a
kind look, or says in his sweet voice, ' Grazie tante,
Antonio mio,' and then I feel as if I could dance
with joy. But sometimes I have to do
without that, and so I can. I feel happy when I am
looking at him, you know," said Antonio, becoming
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 313 -->
terribly confused, " when I am doing something for
him."


\"If he called you bad names, what should you do,
Antonio ?"  
  
  
  " Shut my ears."  
  
  
  ' If he told you to go away from him ?"  
  
  
  " He did once, and I refused to go."  
  
  
  If he drove you out of doors by force ?  
  
  
  " I should come back again."  
  
  
  " But this is to be a dog, not a man."


\"And which is best ?" asked Antonio. " If I was
a man I should be discontented and grumbling;
but as I am Lorini's dog, I am always happy,
you see."


\"Well, Antonio," said Maddalena, " I mean to
love him in the same way."  
  
  
  Antonio shook his head. " You can't," said he.


She smiled, though a little sadly. "You do not
know what a woman can do. But, Antonio, we
must make' him rich. He must live as he did in
the old days. He must bring out his opera.
He must become again the Marchese dei Lorini.
Now, if he refuses to let me help him, what are
we to do ?"
<!-- Leaf 322, Page: 314 -->
  
  Antonio scratched his head. Maddalena gave a

bright smile.


\"You think he would take it, after I am dead,
do you not ? Well, first of all I shall see him in
the villa. Then, if the worst comes to the worst,
I shall go away. A short time afterwards, he shall
receive the news of my death, though I shall not
be dead, all the same. Then he will become
rich, and I shall hide myself somewhere near at
hand."


\"Yes, that will be capital! " cried Antonio. Then
his face became clouded. " But that will not be a
good life for you, signora."


\"Perhaps he will love me a little," she said, " when
he thinks that I am dead, and that I shall never
trouble him again."  
  
  
  " Oh, signora, he loves you now."


"Hush!" she said, raising her forefinger. "You
told me that once before."


A nurse passed them with broths and jellies, and
entered by a little door into Eugenio's room. The
eyes of Antonio and Maddalena followed her with
one look.  
  
  
  "He is getting stronger," said Antonio, "that is
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 315 -->
evident. Ah, signora, don't you wish that we were
going in there ? "  
  
  
  Maddalena sighed.


Darlington came out of the room with a radiant
face. " Convalescence has begun," said he.


Maddalena told him that she had just received a
letter from her lawyer. The Villa Lorini was now
her property. Then she confided to him their idea
of taking Lorini there.


Darlington had remarked with what care and skill
the Brothers of the Misericordia carried invalids
through the streets. Lorini would derive benefit
from the pure air of the hills, and Maddalena, whose
own health was in a very precarious state, would be
occupied in preparing the villa, and so saved from
incessant brooding upon one idea.


"I approve," said he; "and get the villa ready at
once. You will have to work hard, for my patient
will soon be ready for removal. As for our Antonio
here, he may get up to-morrow if he likes."


Whde Maddalena was hurrying over Florence
making purchases and engaging workmen, she was
usually attended by the Signora Pinsuti, who,
<!-- Leaf 324, Page: 316 -->
having saved Eugenio's life, had established a claim
upon her friendship.


When she discovered that Maddalena had heard
of her share in the conspiracy, though ignorant of
the leading part which she had taken, she insisted
on recurring frequently to this unpleasant subject,
apparently for the purpose of backbiting the
Baroness Sackowsky.


\"Ah, dear," she said, " that was a bad woman !—a
bad woman ! What a fatal influence she gained over
me ! And she left me with a smile on her lips,
promising to send me a dress from Paris, and lace
from England, and to write to me every day. I have
never heard from her since, and I found out that
before she left, she went round to all my friends and
poisoned their minds against me. And this after all
my devotion to her. Maddalena, I was infatuated
by that woman. I was her dupe—her slave. You
would never be able to imagine what things she used
to make me do."


Darlington observed that Maddalena's new friend
looked at him with an evil eye; that she evidently
found him il terzo incomodo when he offered his
escort to her and Maddalena; and that she received
<!-- Leaf 325, Page: 317 -->
the news of Lorini's advancing convalescence with
outward demonstrations of joy, which were belied
by the expression of her mouth and eyes. But
presently he observed that she came no more, and
when he asked Maddalena why it was, she blushed,
and gave an evasive reply.


The end of this lady's career may be told at once.
Shortly afterwards her husband died of the miliare,
and the signora, who was now forty-five, became a
devotee, in obedience to an unalterable moral law.
Under the garb of piety she crept into the bosom of
many families, and made it her chief duty to teach
little girls the doctrines of the Catholic religion, and
to prepare their minds for the reception of the
blessed sacrament. But it happened that one of her
protegees made some revelations at the confessional
which astonished the old priest, in spite of his
auricular experience in female sins. The laws of the
Church prevented him from divulging them, but he
warmly exhorted the child to tell her parents what
she had just told him. The parents could not for
their own sake openly expose the Signora Pinsuti,
but they circulated a whisper; other parents
questioned their daight^rs; the result of which was
<!-- Leaf 326, Page: 318 -->
that this mentor of youth lost all her pupils, and was
compelled to leave Florence at once. She entered a
nunnery at Naples, where she lived for a long time
universally beloved, and died unanimously
unregretted.


One day Lorini awoke, as it seemed to him, from
a long sleep. He found himself in a bed with yellow
curtains. At a little distance were two other beds.

A woman dressed in a blue gown bent over him, and
placed her hand upon his brow; he smiled and went
to sleep.


The next time that he awoke it was night. An
oil-light was burning on a little table at the bed-side.
He tried to think, but the effort tired his brain, and
he slept again.


But the third time he felt his head more clear; he
saw that he was in the hospital; he attempted to
recall the past. Was that a dream which he had
had ? A priest standing before him in his robes,
and a mob of faces, and the voice of Charles
Darlington, and a dull murmur like that of the sea ?


The nurse passed by the bed. He pointed to a
little mirror which was hung against the wall. She
<!-- Leaf 327, Page: 319 -->
brought it him; he looked in it and saw a white
attenuated face, which he scarcely recognised to be
his own. He put his hand to his head; the hair
was just beginning to grow.  
  
  
  Ah ! thought he, I have had the miliare.


Darlington came in just then. He said that he
was making a tour in Italy, and that he had
discovered him by accident in articido mortis.
Nothingwas said about Maddalena.


He became stronger and stronger, and expressed
a wish to get up. One morning he found himself
lying in a black litter, and being borne swiftly but
smoothly along by men with masked faces, and
dressed in long black gowns. They passed with him
through a gate, and along a cypress avenue.


\"Ah ! " said he, " that is right. I shall be more
comfortable in my own house." He forgot at the
moment that it was no longer his.


He was carried into his old bedroom, and being
under the influence of an opiate, he soon slept again.
Several days passed. He could now sit up in the
bed, and could read and could converse.


"Darlington," said he, one day, "this is the Villa
Lorini."
<!-- Leaf 328, Page: 320 -->
  
  " Yes," said Darlington.  
  
  
  " But how do I come here ? "


\"You were brought by the Brothers of the
Misericordia."


\"Yes, I know that; but I mean, having sold the
villa, what right have I to live in it ?"


"The present owner of the villa is a friend of
mine. I told her that I meant to have you removed
to the hills. She very naturally offered you a suite
of apartments here."  
  
  
  " She—it is a lady then ? "
\"Yes."  
  
  
  " And she has given me a suite of apartments ?


\"Yes. Do you feel yourself strong enough to go
into your sitting-room ? "  
  
  
  " Yes," he said, eagerly; " I am getting so tired of

bed."


\"A very good sign," said Darlington, who rang the
bell. Antonio and another servant earned him into
the saloon of the villa, and laid him on a couch. He
looked round. Books and papers were scattered
about just as they used to be in former times. The
furniture was new, but a sac-simile of the old. There
was nothing in the room which had not been there
<!-- Leaf 329, Page: 321 -->
two years and a-half before, except the manuscript
«
of his opera, which was laid on the piano.


\"My friend," said Eugenio, in a fluttering voice,
\"who is she, this person who has bought my villa ?"


\"A rich parvenue, with some absurdly romantic
ideas, but a very good-hearted woman, for all that.
You will see her soon, no doubt."


Eugenio sighed, and said no more. He was now
nursed by Antonio, whose tenderness and care
supplied the place of experience and skill. But once
he found a woman's handkerchief upon the coverlet
of his bed. He seized it, and examined it with
avidity. It was not marked, but he felt it all damp
with tears.


Who was this mysterious woman who gave him
her house, who wept over him, who would not let
him see her face, whom Darlington declared to be a
parvenue, and whom Antonio swore that he had
never seen. Devoured by curiosity he could think
of nothing else.


He was now able to walk about the salon, where
everything reminded him of Maddalena. Once he
found a book open at a passage which he had read
to her, and which he had made her learn by heart.  
  
  
  VOL. II. T
<!-- Leaf 330, Page: 322 -->
Once he found some red camellias scattered on the
»
table. In the winter he had always made her wear
those flowers in her hair. He became convinced that
it was Maddalena who had bought the villa. He
said so to Darlington, who pretended to deride so
preposterous an idea.


An expression of bitter disappointment crossed his
face; Darlington told Maddalena that the experiment
might be made.


One afternoon Eugenio was asleep on the couch
in the salon. He was awoke by music—the most
delicate luxury that the senses can enjoy.


But a luxury of the heart awaited him as well.
He recognised the air—it was from his opera—
it was La Donati's confession of love. He recognised
the voice : it was Maddalena's.


\"MADDALENA !" he cried, and she came in, her
face shining- with the light of which smiles are born.
She came to him, and without speaking, laid her
head upon his breast.


They remained thus for a little while too happy to
speak. They both felt inclined to cry.


\"Maddalena ! " he said, softly, " I am thy guest,
am I not ?"
<!-- Leaf 331, Page: 323 -->

"No, Eugenio,'I am thine : this villa belongs to
thee."  
  
  
  " I accept it," he said.
She gave a cry of joy.  
  
  
  " Maddalena, forgive me for what is past."  
  
  
  " Nay, Eugenio, forgive me for what is past."


Then they began to dispute which was most to
blame. They painted themselves in the blackest
colours, and neither would listen to the other.


"But it is enough of the past," said Eugenio.
"We will not sing Tempo Passato any more. My
darling, thou wilt stay with me always, wilt thou
not ?"


\"Yes, always, dearest Eugenio. I will never leave
thee again."


"Art thou sure?" he said, with an air of incre
dulity.


\"Oh, Eugenio !" she cried, the tears coming to
her eyes.


\"I must take my precautions," he said, in a stern
voice. " I must bind thee to me, little runaway. I
must render thee subject to the laws of the Church."'


She sprang from him, and looked at him with
startled eyes.
<!-- Leaf 332, Page: 324 -->

"Come, patient, long-suffering heart," he cried,
stretching out his arms, " come, rest on mine, and
never leave it more."


Then he sang in a whisper that promise which he
had once made in sport:—  
  
  
  A consolarmi affrettisi
0 giorno sospirato !  
  
  
  Innanzi al cielo agli uomini
Tuo sposo diverro."


\"Oh, Eugenio !" she cried, flinging her arms round
his neck.


\"Why, what is all this ?" said Darlington, coming
in. " Here is the lady who promised not to excite
my patient, in a state of very passable excitement
herself."


\"Doctor," said Eugenio, " when shall I be
strongenough to leave the house ?"  
  
  
  " Where do you want to go ?"
\"To a church."  
  
  
  " To a church ! and why ? "
\"Maddalena is going with me."  
  
  
  " Then you must wait a month at least."


"And he will not be the last of the Lorini,
after all," cried Antonio, rushing wildly from
<!-- Leaf 333, Page: 325 -->
the room, where apparently he had been
concealed.


It was one of the first warm evenings of the year.
Eugenio, wrapped in furs, was seated on the marble
bench, with Maddalena at his side. Below them lay
Florence, with her thousand lamps, beautiful and
bright as if they were reflections of the stars above.


"Dost thou remember," he whispered, "that
night when we sat here—when thy hand by accident
touched mine—when that air from Torquato Tasso
first called up love from the bottom of my heart ?"


\"Dost thou remember," she replied, " when I came
out here and found the jewels, and thou wert hid
behind the trees ?"


"And dost thou remember how we used to sit
here hand in hand, as we do now, and look upon the
stars and listen to the city chimes?"


"Yes, yes, Eugenio, all our sweetest memories lie
here; like ghosts they hover round us."


\"We will make them take life again. Maddalena,
to-morrow!"


\"Yes, to-morrow! my Eugenio." She glanced at
him, and they blushed together.
<!-- Leaf 334, Page: 326 -->

Darlington, followed by Antonio, came towards
them.


"Eugenio," he said, "you must come in; it is
growing cold. I am still your tyrant, you know.
After to-morrow you will be free."


\"Ah, yes," sighed Maddalena; " that is the only
drawback to our happiness, that you must go."  
  
  
  " You must visit me in England."


\"Yes," she said, " for you we will do that. But
nothing else should make us go near that odious land."


Eugenio was seated between his friend and his
betrothed, each of whom held a hand in theirs.
Antonio was crouched at his feet, which he furtively
kissed now and then.


\"Oh," said Eugenio, " what have I done to merit
all this love ? This love from thee, Maddalena ?
This love from thee, Antonio ? Even Jenoure saved
my patrimony from a stranger's hands, and you, dear
Charles, have saved my life. What return can I
ever make to you ? "


\"By being good to Maddalena," he replied, in a
solemn voice. " If you owe me any gratitude, pay
it to this dear girl, to whom you owe much
more."
<!-- Leaf 335, Page: 327 -->

The lovers looked with surprise at Darlington.
In what a strange tone he had spoken, and how sad
his face had turned! He had just thought of the
letter from Jenoure.


\"You must think of something else," said
Eugenio, trying to laugh. " I already owe
Maddalena more debts of the heart than I shall ever live
to repay. Besides, they will go on increasing, I
fear."


\"Well, as for myself," said the doctor, cheerfully,
"you make me the best return when you talk and
laugh. Do you remember my dispute with Jenoure
as to whether doctors were artists or not ? Well,
I look upon you as a medical masterpiece, my friend.
I feel the same pleasure in seeing you walk and in
hearing you speak as Jenoure has in looking at a
finished picture, or as you will have when you listen
to your opera admirably sung."


"And what feeling have you," said Maddalena,
\"when you see me here with him, and not unworthy
of him, as I might have been ? You have saved
Eugenio from death, but you have saved me from
that which is worse than death."  
  
  
  " It gives me pleasure," he replied, " to pluck a
<!-- Leaf 336, Page: 328 -->
man out of the jaws of death; and yet I know that
this life has many miseries, and that after all he
must die some day. But to save a heart from
anguish and woe, or from sinfulness and shame—ah !
that gives me happiness indeed. It is a happiness
which Heaven has allowed me often to enjoy.
Under a doctor's disguise, I go as a missionary
among suffering souls, and my labours have not
been all in vain. This is my religion, Maddalena;
and these are the prayers which I offer up to God."
